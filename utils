            <p>Chapter 1: Fabrications Become Reality, An Increase in Skill Level&nbsp;</p><p>The booming sound that echoed through the room instantly caught the attention of the guards outside.
"Your holiness, are you okay?!" they asked, filled with concern and surprise.
How did such a terrifying sound suddenly come from the room? Could it be that the holiness is breaking through?
At this point, Su Changqing heard the guards' inquiries and replied calmly, "I'm fine, you may leave."
He didn't say much, for he was currently experiencing a full-body upgrade! The Mixing Supreme Bone inside of him was fusing!
This process was undoubtedly both painful and enjoyable.
Once it was completely integrated, his path of cultivation would reach a whole new level!
As he felt the rumbling and tearing pain within his body, Su Changqing bit his teeth and took deep breaths, pale-faced.
"With these rewards, not only will I receive an unprecedented increase in skill level, but I can also more conveniently fabricate a diary to gain the diary holder's trust," he thought long-term, murmuring to himself.
Moments later...
Golden light shone from Su Changqing's body as ripples danced across the surroundings.
"It's a successful fusion!!!" he roared with veins visible on his forehead.
Currently, he could feel that every aspect of his body had been elevated!
After fusing with the Mixing Supreme Bone, his entire person underwent a huge improvement!
Especially regarding physique, it was even more apparent!
At this moment, he felt indescribable relief, causing him to be absorbed in this comfortable feeling.
In the next second, all the information in Su Changqing's mind was successfully imprinted!
"The True Dragon Technique...I can only master it slowly?" he inquired, asking the Abacus System.
[Yes, the full power of True Dragon Technique possesses indomitable combat power, placing the technique at the top of the Ten Fierce Techniques. A single move is comparable to immortal-level magic!]
After receiving the answer, Su Changqing blinked and understood that if he mastered all of it at once, wouldn't it make him invincible? Then, what's the point of fabricating the diary?
"The first of the Ten Fierce Techniques...and is related to the reward I fabricated in the diary, so...can I continue to fabricate and then receive all the other rewards after obtaining even higher trust points?" he murmured, feeling quite expectant.
Will the "Ruthless Man" and "Deserted"...existences become true?
Just the thought of it was thrilling!
However, before Su Changqing could dwell on it too much...
"Hmm!?" His whole body shook, feeling a splitting pain that came from his dantian!
At this moment, his body was like a melting pot, seemingly accommodating something.</p><p>The critical point has been reached! 
Only after he came to his senses did he realize that his cultivation had reached the pinnacle of the Divine King Realm! 
"Boom, boom, boom..." 
The bones made a sound like firecrackers, and the terrifying spiritual power within him was continuously attempting to break free from its shackles! 
At this moment, 
Su Changqing had to focus all of his attention on breaking through. 
"Breath... Breath..." 
He closed his eyes, and his breathing became increasingly rapid! 
Then, in the next second... 
"Boom!!!" 
A tremendous roar echoed from the surrounding void! 
The entire room shook violently! 
In an instant... 
The shackles were broken! 
Su Changqing's white robe floated on its own, and a shocking aura rose into the sky! 
"Divine King Nine Heavens..." 
He was excited, once again gathering the spiritual power within his body to impact the Great Perfection! 
And it was precisely at this moment, 
The roaring continued, echoing throughout the entire mountain peak! 
The spiritual energy from all directions seemed to be attracted towards Su Changqing's room! 
With the naked eye, a giant vortex was gradually forming at the top of the mountain peak! 
The booming sound was like a roar from a prehistoric beast, resounding to the heavens! 
The entire Saint's Peak, 
Was at this moment, violently shaking, giving rise to a deafening explosion! 
Under the hurricane-like winds, 
The entire Dao One Holy Sect was alarmed! 
Countless figures dashed out, stepping onto the void, and their gazes all looked towards Saint's Peak! 
At this moment, a massive vortex continued to form atop the mountain peak! 
Especially under the terrified gazes, 
The spiritual vortex was continuously expanding and spreading! 
"Rumble..." 
The heavens and earth shook violently, and the entire sect was trembling! 
The previously bright moon in the sky was now directly covered by black clouds! 
Countless stars disappeared, and boundless darkness suddenly descended! 
Outside, inside the gates... 
Countless Dao One Sect disciples had their expressions change dramatically, staring blankly at Saint's Peak where Su Changqing was located! 
"That... that's... Saint's Son!" 
"What is happening? The spiritual energy is terrifying, and all of it is converging towards Saint's Peak!!!" 
"This... this... this aura... Saint's Son has broken through?!" 
"Wait, didn't Saint's Son just breakthrough to the Divine King Realm less than a month ago? And now he's broken through again??" 
As they observed the shaking Saint's Peak, the spiritual vortex that was converging from all directions to a frightening degree, they all cried out in surprise! 
And among the many disciples, 
The elders of the outer and inner gates, without exception, had solemn expressions, but then revealed an ecstatic expression. 
"Saint's Son, Saint's Son has broken through again!!!" 
"God, in less than a month, he has already broken through to the Divine King, again?!"</p><p>"Wang Jiuchongtian!" 
"Indeed, he is the holy son of Dao Yi Sect, the strongest holy son in the history of the sect, and the holy son with the most unlimited potential in the future!!!" 
Even as elders, they were all shocked by Su Changqing's lightning-fast cultivation! 
Once they came back to their senses, they couldn't help but exclaim and discuss in amazement! 
With such an unprecedented and unparalleled holy son of Dao Yi Sect, its status in Jiuxuanå¤© will undoubtedly rise! 
At this moment, Su Changqing's breath began to rise again!!! 
"Boom!!! " 
Amidst lightning and thunder, the terrifying spiritual energy was absorbed at an astonishing speed! 
And the entire Holy Son Peak shook even more violently! 
Together with the entire sect, it also became restless! 
It seemed as if the sky was collapsing, and the heavens were falling! 
Within a radius of hundreds of miles... 
The earth shook!!! 
Above the horizon, countless rhythms enveloped the Holy Son Peak, amidst the deafening roars. 
Whoever witnessed this sudden movement and vision was once again frightened! 
"This... this... isn't over yet? " 
"Holy son... will he still attempt to break through the perfection of the god king?!" 
"This breath..." 
They felt the breath that belonged to Su Changqing, the god king in Jiuchongtian, and their mouths were dry and their faces were pale! 
He had just made a breakthrough, and now he was attempting to break through to the perfection of the god king! 
Such courage was seldom seen in the world! 
In the midst of everyone's shock and horror, a figure quietly appeared in the void! 
When they saw the appearance of the middle-aged man... 
"Grand Elder!" 
Everyone's expression was respectful, but they couldn't hide the look of shock in their eyes! 
At this moment, they immediately looked towards the Holy Son Peak again, and their hearts surged with waves of shock! 
The grand elder of Dao Yi Sect, Ouyang Yan, had a solemn expression, and a hint of madness flashed in his deep eyes! 
"Changqing..." 
He breathed heavily and was quite excited inside! 
But soon, his whole body trembled! 
He found that the overwhelming breath that belonged to Su Changqing made him frightened! 
This!!!

            <p>Chapter 1: Ling Qianxue's Encouragement, Is This a Confession?&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Su Changqing looked at Ling Qianxue with a rare gentle smile on his face, despite the fact that he was constantly scrutinizing her. But it was precisely because of this that Ling Qianxue was at a loss for how to react to Su Changqing's warm smile.&nbsp;</p><p>"He...he..." &nbsp;</p><p>"Senior brother, are you seeing me as my future self?" &nbsp;</p><p>For some reason, her heart ached even more. This was the first time she had seen her senior brother smile like this, especially with the worldly experience that could be seen in his eyes - what had he gone through exactly?&nbsp;</p><p>She could even see a glimmer of joy in her senior brother's eyes as he heard her words. Could it be that the person he had wanted to see, as mentioned in his diary, was herself?&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking of this, Ling Qianxue's heart beat faster and her eyes darted around as she spoke softly, "Senior brother, congratulations on breaking through to the Holy level and becoming the most powerful saint son of the Dao Yi Holy Sect..."&nbsp;</p><p>"The strongest saint son? It's just an empty name..." Su Changqing chuckled self-deprecatingly.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing this, Ling Qianxue hesitated to speak, wondering if her senior brother was really giving up.&nbsp;</p><p>"Senior brother... you..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Junior sister, to outsiders, the Saint level is indeed unattainable, but...there is no end to the path of cultivation. What is the point of being a Saint or the strongest saint son? It's all fleeting. All I want is to live this life simply and peacefully," Su Changqing shook his head and said with a light laugh.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon hearing this, Ling Qianxue was shaken. Senior Brother didn't know that he had already learned about the future, so...&nbsp;</p><p>Is he giving up?!&nbsp;</p><p>"Senior brother!" &nbsp;</p><p>Based on the diary, Ling Qianxue imagined the scene where Su Changqing was resisting until the very last moment, and with a serious expression, she said, "Do you still remember? The Saint Lord... our Master, has always said that only by continuously getting stronger can we obtain what we want!"&nbsp;</p><p>"I may not know what senior brother wants, but... I can see that his mentality has changed!" &nbsp;</p><p>"Is it only empty words? Just fleeting? Easy to live one's life simply? But senior brother, you are the saint son of the Dao Yi Holy Sect, and if you can't become a Saint, then strive for Immortal or Supreme or Emperor..." &nbsp;</p><p>"With your talent, the path of cultivation has no end. So let us strive towards the end!" &nbsp;</p><p>After saying all this in one breath, Ling Qianxue's eyes became more determined. No matter what, she would never allow her senior brother to give up voluntarily!&nbsp;</p><p>This was something she never wanted to see!&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing was surprised, and took a deep breath, "Junior sister... you..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Senior brother, I have always been foolishly chasing after your footsteps, hoping to surpass you, but now I understand that you have been indulging me!"&nbsp;</p><p>"The path of cultivation..."</p><p>"The road has no end, senior brother. If you don't try, how will you know there is no end?" Ling Qianxue's heart raced faster as she spoke, until her whole body felt hot. She didn't know why, but saying these words made her feel much lighter.&nbsp;</p><p>But at this moment, the disciples of the holy land who had learned that the saintess was headed for the Saint Son peak were completely dumbfounded!&nbsp;</p><p>"This...the Saint Son...the Saintess...them???"&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh my god!!!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Forever behind you...hiss, is the Saintess confessing to the Saint Son? This can't be!!!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Ah!!! What did I hear!?"&nbsp;</p><p>Not one of them didn't stare wide-eyed, feeling thunderstruck!&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, the saintess who was not familiar with, and even had little interaction with the Saint Son, had spoken so many startling words!&nbsp;</p><p>What happened? What is this situation???&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, cries of shock sounded from all sides! Everyone had a dumbfounded expression and took in a sharp breath!&nbsp;</p><p>In their eyes, the Saint Son and the Saintess were two completely different people, and there was simply no possibility of any interaction between them. But now...&nbsp;</p><p>The saintess, like an iceberg that had lasted for thousands of years, had spoken such astonishing words!&nbsp;</p><p>This not only made them feel inexplicable, but also made them dizzy and felt like they were dreaming!&nbsp;</p><p>Hearing the cries of shock around her, as well as seeing more and more disciples gathering around...&nbsp;</p><p>Ling Qianxue appeared a little uneasy, and her normally cool face became even redder.&nbsp;</p><p>At this time, Su Changqing looked at Ling Qianxue, who was restless in front of him, feeling pleased.&nbsp;</p><p>"Like this? Okay!"&nbsp;</p><p>He nodded his head in agreement, then smiled lightly and said, "Sister, I can see that your breath is unstable after just breaking through. Rest more."&nbsp;</p><p>Others didn't know, but he was very clear.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, the saintess in front of him was the owner of the diary copy!&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing Su Changqing agree and hearing his sudden concern...&nbsp;</p><p>Ling Qianxue couldn't help but nod shyly, but at this moment, she saw the diary copy update.&nbsp;</p><p>"The person I most want to see, my sister, and also my wife, has come to find me..."&nbsp;</p><p>"In the future, we will fight side by side, even leaving the Nine Abysses to go to various realms to fight against the darkness and turmoil. However, for me, you burned your soul and perished with those cursed ones, leaving me alone!"&nbsp;</p><p>"For so many years after that, I struggled and hated myself. Why couldn't I have protected you? Why wasn't the one who died me, but the one who lived...that's the most painful thing!"&nbsp;</p><p>"I once said that I would step on the Nine Heavens and the Ten Earths, shatter all illusions and avenge you, even if it meant that I would fail in the end!"&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sorry..."</p><p>ãI've lived for so long and been reborn. My junior sister is still alive, just like how I remember her, still so young. It's great...ã 
ãAfter all these years of missing her, my junior sister is right in front of me. I...really want to hug you, hold your hand, and say those words "I miss you!"ã 
ãBut...my junior sister still doesn't know what our future holds!ã 
ãHow can I explain to her and express this longing?ã 
ãForget it, it's fine like this. But in this lifetime, I want to meet, know and love my junior sister earlier!ã 
ãIf the ending can't be changed, I hope that before destruction comes in this world, you can stay happy all the way.ã 
Reading the latest diary entry, Ling Qianxue's heart trembled, her breath quickening. 
"I died to save my senior brother?" 
After learning about her future cause of death, she felt a little uncomfortable but also somewhat happy. At least she could accompany her senior brother and fight with him... 
"The person who's alive...is the most miserable..." 
When she saw this sentence, Ling Qianxue's heart suddenly ached and her gaze became somewhat vacant. 
"Senior brother..." 
She looked at the diary content, feeling extremely complex emotions. Did her senior brother suffer so much after she died in the future? Until...the last moment! 
This pain, this longing... 
After finishing the diary, Ling Qianxue's face was already red, unable to look directly into Su Changqing's eyes. 
"Senior brother..." 
Her heart beating faster, she even had the impulse to hug her future husband in front of her tightly. Tell him, she actually knew it all! 
But she still couldn't summon the courage and was afraid that her emotions would really get out of control! 
Ling Qianxue blushed and hastily said: "Senior brother...I...I'm going back first." 
Her heart was pounding as she quickly took her leave.

            <p>Chapter 1: How did Su Changqing know? Verified Everything!&nbsp;</p><p>The next day, at the Holy Son Peak, Su Changqing spent the entire morning lazing around before remembering to continue writing the second diary entry.&nbsp;</p><p>"Ling Qianxue and Su Yuwei's trust value is still acceptable, it's just this Murong Dieyi..." he muttered. Currently, the trust value from the demonic witch of the demon sect towards the diary was relatively low.&nbsp;</p><p>This was unacceptable, he had to make sure of their complete trust in the diary!&nbsp;</p><p>After some thought, Su Changqing's eyes brightened and he chuckled, "I don't believe it, I can't let you fully trust it!"&nbsp;</p><p>"So what if she's a witch? It's useless!"&nbsp;</p><p>He had confidence in his plan and didn't worry too much. After all, he had read the original work and while the author may have seemed foolish in some ways, certain plot points were not beyond redemption.&nbsp;</p><p>With those thoughts aside, Su Changqing continued writing the second diary entry.&nbsp;</p><p>"So many things in the future...luckily, for now, Qianxue Junior Sister and Yuwei Little Loli will be safe!" he wrote, before adding a note about Dieyi's mission.&nbsp;</p><p>"If I remember correctly, she should be cleaning up the Mo Clan's mess today by heading to the Ten Thousand Demon Caves at the bottom of the Ghost Sea. The target is the Third Elder of the sect's inner sect. Despite completing the mission, she gets injured in a fight with the team of inner sect elders."&nbsp;</p><p>"Also, the ghost sea that's 100 miles away from the Mo Clan's sea still contains a deactivated devil emperor's relic."&nbsp;</p><p>"Within it grows a 10,000-year-old magic element fruit made from the residual blood of the devil emperor. It should be mature by now!"&nbsp;</p><p>"If Dieyi can take advantage of this opportunity, then...her ancient demon inside her will activate a part of it, and her strength will at least be able to break through the Saint Realm in a short period of time!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Not only that, her growth time line should be shortened. The only problem is that I can't tell her about this now, but it doesn't matter. It's just a 10,000-year magic element fruit. I'll give it to her when I revisit her!"&nbsp;</p><p>"This life, we must all be good!"&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, over at the demon sect, Murong Dieyi had secretly left the sect and was heading down to the sea area below the gate at a rapid pace.&nbsp;</p><p>"Third Elder..." she muttered, her purple eyes filled with a dangerous light and a small smirk on her lips.&nbsp;</p><p>Colluding with other sects to corrode the demonic sect's heritage? Then she would just have to kill them!&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, the diary refreshed.&nbsp;</p><p>Murong Dieyi was taken aback and furrowed her brows slightly, muttering, "Why is it updating now? Su Changqing...I don't like your timing for updates."&nbsp;</p><p>As she said that, she stared intently at the diary.</p><p>starts here&nbsp;</p><p>"Why are those two women mentioned again?" Muyong Dieyi frowned as she read the first line of the diary. But as she continued reading, her body trembled slightly.&nbsp;</p><p>"How does he know about this?" she muttered to herself as she read about Su Changqing's motives for his actions, including his target and destination, which were all correct. She was the only one who knew about this mission along with the demonic lord. Even the disciples and elders of the sect had no idea, except for knowing that the third elder had yet to return.&nbsp;</p><p>But somehow, Su Changqing, who was miles away in the Dao Yi Holy Sect, knew everything in detail. Could he have been reborn? Otherwise, how could he have known all of this? Muyong Dieyi was perplexed by this, but her curiosity was piqued.&nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing, you are quite interesting," she said with a chuckle.&nbsp;</p><p>She scoffed when she read that she would be injured. It was impossible for her to be harmed. But as she read further, her eyes widened in excitement when she saw the words "devil far fruit."&nbsp;</p><p>"He knows about my bloodline?" she thought to herself. But then she wondered why the sect had not discovered it yet. If her cultivation was not high enough, then the demonic lord would not have noticed it either.&nbsp;</p><p>Muyong Dieyi felt conflicted about the contents of the diary, and decided she would not dwell on it. She had her sights set on her destination: the Demon's Pit. She had to take care of the traitors within the sect.&nbsp;</p><p>After two hours, she arrived at the Demon's Pit, where she was met with a gruesome scene: Dead bodies littered the area, and the surrounding water was stained red with blood and had a pungent smell.&nbsp;</p><p>Muyong Dieyi's eyes glowed with a bright purple light as she looked around. She was terrifying. "Third elder, rest assured," she sneered, grabbing a bloody heart and squeezing it into mist. An elderly man in front of her with a weak aura stared with wide eyes, unable to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>"You truly deserve your ancient demonic bloodline," he finally managed to utter.&nbsp;</p><p>The story continues but unfortunately, the input text has been cut off.</p><p>"Not finished speaking, form and spirit annihilated! Until the old man dies, Mu Rong Die Yi's sneer on her face disappears, her expression suddenly pale. "Hoo...hoo..." She gasps for breath, and blood spills from the corners of her mouth. She is really injured! How could this...Su Changqing, everything he said was absolutely correct! He not only knows what she needs to do now, but even knows that she will be injured after completing it! Oh my god!!!"
At this moment, Mu Rong Die Yi's heart is shaken again, feeling unbelievable. "Then...then what he said about the opportunity, the demon yuan fruit..." She trembles with excitement, and her heart is really moved now! If Su Changqing is telling the truth, getting the demon yuan fruit will lead to a huge improvement! Anyway, at this point, what he said was all true!
After taking a deep breath, Mu Rong Die Yi slightly recovered from her injuries, and went straight to the location she saw in the diary! "Su Changqing, I hope you're not talking nonsense, or I won't spare you!" She snorted and continued to speed up! At the same time, her heart became more and more thirsty! Hoping it is true! After almost half an hour, Mu Rong Die Yi arrived at the sea area under the sect, a hundred miles away. "This...is the abandoned ruins left after a demon emperor fell?" She looked around and indeed saw the remnants of buildings. But where is the demon yuan fruit? She immediately began to search, and stopped her figure after a while! Just ahead, in the darkness, there were bursts of purple light continuously flashing, accompanied by a strong demonic energy as she drew near! She saw clearly that it was a strange fruit the size of a fist, entirely purple and covered with complex patterns! Around it were giant beasts eroded by demonic energy! Seeing this scene, "Then...this is the demon yuan fruit?!!!" Mu Rong Die Yi suddenly felt dry in her mouth and couldn't keep calm anymore, and had to believe it! From the voice in her ear, she heard the desperate desire for the fruit. This is the opportunity Su Changqing mentioned, and once she can get it, she will have a huge improvement! This guy really is telling the truth!!!!

            <p>Chapter 4: Xiaoxiantai is About to Emerge, The Battle for Great World Begins!&nbsp;</p><p>Half a month later, in the Way of One Holy Sect, on the peak of Saint Son Mountain, Su Changqing looked at the nearby Saint Daughter Mountain with a satisfied smile on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>"In half a month's time, Ling Qianxue actually found me twice on her own initiative," he muttered, feeling quite pleased with himself.&nbsp;</p><p>The past half month had been uneventful, with nothing out of the ordinary happening. If things continued to develop this way, he wouldn't have to worry about his identity as the villain at all. As for his enemies? It seemed he didn't have to worry about them either. He spent his days leisurely, occasionally writing in his diary to make fun of the heroines and reveal some small details from the original text.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, while enjoying his life, Su Changqing watched as the trust level of the three heroines in his diary gradually increased.&nbsp;</p><p>"If it continues like this, that would be great...But I can't stop writing in my diary, the trust levels of the three diary holders are good, they have to be maintained," he muttered to himself, thinking about what he should fabricate next.&nbsp;</p><p>But just as he was thinking about it, his face suddenly changed!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Su Changqing's face became serious, and he took a deep breath.&nbsp;</p><p>"I remember now! It's been more than half a month since new disciples were last recruited, and soon, something big is going to happen!" His eyes lit up as he had an idea of what to write next.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the original text, it shouldn't take long for the "Heavenly Talent List" to appear! If he fabricated some information, wouldn't it be perfect?&nbsp;</p><p>Without any hesitation, Su Changqing decided to update his diary today.&nbsp;</p><p>"After resting for a few days, I almost forgot about something! It shouldn't take long for the Heavenly Talent List to appear in Jiuxuan Heaven, right?"&nbsp;</p><p>"If I remember correctly...the Heavenly Talent List isn't just limited to Jiuxuan Heaven, but comes from Xiaoxiantai, and each world has its own branch!"&nbsp;</p><p>"And when Xiaoxiantai appears, the Heavenly Talent List will appear in all worlds!"&nbsp;</p><p>"The battle for the great world in all the realms is about to begin..."&nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>As Su Changqing updated his diary, on the Saint Daughter Mountain, Ling Qianxue was originally intending to inquire about news on Lin Fan, but the man seemed to have disappeared without a trace.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you have the ability, don't ever show your face again!" she spoke coldly, her eyes filled with indescribable killing intent.&nbsp;</p><p>Before she could even consider whether she should go to Saint Son Mountain today and try to encourage her senior brother not to lose his fighting spirit, something unexpected happened.</p><p>The replica diary slowly surfaced. 
"Did Senior Brother finally update?" 
Ling Qianxue immediately looked intently at it, but was surprised. 
"Tianjiao Ranking? Little Xiantai?" 
She was confused and couldn't understand what this was about. Especially the last sentence in the diary, "The chaotic era is about to begin?" 
Now, Ling Qianxue trembled all over and her eyes were full of gravity. "What's going on? So many things will happen in the future? Does the little Xiantai come from various worlds?" 
She suddenly felt that Senior Brother knew too much, and new future things kept coming before people could digest them! 
As for the chaotic era? Is it also the cause of the darkness and turmoil? 
In an instant, Ling Qianxue put aside her thoughts of killing Lin Fan and only wanted to understand the struggle of the Tianjiao Ranking and the future trend from the various worlds! 
"Senior Brother... What have you experienced in the future!?" 
Apart from surprise, she was eager to know everything! 
...... 
Da Yu Dynasty, at this moment. 
Su Yuwei was in her room, bored and propping up her chin. 
"Stinky Su Changqing, how come there's no update on the diary?" 
"I want to see the diary!" 
She paced back and forth, stomping her feet from time to time, looking quite cute. 
During this period of time, Su Changqing's diary occasionally disclosed some small things about herself and two other girls in the future. 
Especially that she will stick to Su Changqing in the future... 
Thinking of this, Su Yuwei's little face flushed, pouting her mouth. "Am I really that clingy???" 
She was a bit skeptical, humming to herself. 
However, many of the things Su Changqing revealed in the diary were unexpected! 
But, unfortunately, some of the revealed things had already happened! 
Just when Su Yuwei was waiting for the diary to be updated, the replica diary appeared and opened automatically. 
"Huh?!" 
When she saw the first line, she blinked in surprise. 
The Tianjiao Ranking was about to be born? 
However...this so-called Tianjiao Ranking is still a branch of the Little Xiantai in each world in the various worlds? She hadn't even heard of it. 
But soon... 
Chaos was about to come to Jiu Xuan Heaven? 
Even the great trend of the various worlds would begin!? 
Oh my god! 
After completely reading the content of the diary update, Su Yuwei held her little hand, blinked in disbelief. "No way? Chaos is coming?" 
She was caught off guard and felt a little uneasy.</p><p>Translation: &nbsp;</p><p>I have yet to fully awaken the power of the divine phoenix and have only just begun on the path of cultivation. And now, the chaotic times have arrived? At this moment, Su Qingyun arrived and felt the increasingly powerful aura emanating from his daughter. He was pleased and said, "My good daughter, you are already at the seventh level of the spiritual sea?!" In less than a month, she had made significant progress from just starting out, almost breaking through the myriad transformations! Such speed amazed even him, a monarch. &nbsp;</p><p>Seeing her father approach, Su Yuwei only nodded perfunctorily before earnestly asking, "Daddy, do you... know about Xiaoxiandai?" She was eager to find out more about what was hinted at in Su Changqing's diary. &nbsp;</p><p>However, upon hearing his daughter's words, Su Qingyun's face changed dramatically. "What... what did you say?!" &nbsp;</p><p>"Xiaoxiandai, do you know about it, Daddy?" &nbsp;</p><p>"This... who told you about it?" &nbsp;</p><p>"Daddy, nevermind that, just tell me, do you know?" &nbsp;</p><p>Su Yuwei was alarmed at her father's reaction. It seemed like he might know something! Su Qingyun's expression became vague, then he trembled all over. "Xiaoxiandai? I, your daddy, know a little about it." &nbsp;</p><p>After regaining his composure, his expression became serious as he slowly said, "Our divine dynasty has inherited records from ancient times, left behind by our ancestors. They have recorded that with the appearance of Xiaoxiandai, a chaotic era will arise! It has been tens of thousands of years since the last appearance of Xiaoxiandai, even before I was born. I had forgotten about it, but upon hearing you mention it..." &nbsp;</p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yuwei's eyes widened in disbelief. Was it true? Even the things that Su Changqing had said? &nbsp;</p><p>She took a deep breath, looking stunned. Even when Su Qingyun asked where she heard that from, she didn't seem to realize anything. &nbsp;</p><p>Upon seeing his daughter in a daze, Su Qingyun's expression became even more solemn. "Could it be that Wei'er found out about this through the divine phoenix? Is chaos really coming..." He had a thousand questions and couldn't help but worry. &nbsp;</p><p>P.S.: The author has a new book release and will definitely work hard to update it frequently with guaranteed quality!

            <p>Chapter 1: Su Changqing, 6th on the Sendai Heavenly List?&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, a loud explosion echoed through the Nine Abyss Heavens. In the blink of an eye, the world changed, and the sky and earth shook violently. Countless people looked up at the sky at the same time. With thunder and lightning flashing, the sky glowed with a dazzling purple light, creating a terrifying aura that seemed to destroy the world.&nbsp;</p><p>At that moment, the purple light became more and more intense, and a crack appeared in the sky above. A desolate and bleak atmosphere filled the air. The entire world was shaking violently, and the deafening roar seemed endless.&nbsp;</p><p>Amidst countless eyes, a voice rang out from the sky, "The Little Sendai is here, and the heavens are in turmoil. Who will compete for the top spot? The vast and boundless world, the great path is eternal. The Nine Abyss Heavens...the Sendai Heavenly List...will soon be announced."&nbsp;</p><p>Ancient and mysterious voices echoed from the sky. Suddenly, a dazzling and brilliant giant list, as if made of some mysterious meteorite, appeared at the top of the sky. The glorious light illuminated the entire world, and the Sendai Heavenly List made the sky and earth shake completely.&nbsp;</p><p>Countless people saw this scene, their scalp tingling and their hearts shaking. What is going on? Before the people from the Nine Abyss Heavens could react...&nbsp;</p><p>"The top ten...can enter the list!"&nbsp;</p><p>"The Sendai Heavenly List, now announcing!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Sixth place: Su Changqing, the Saint of Dao One Sect!"&nbsp;</p><p>As the names appeared one by one on the Sendai Heavenly List, the Nine Abyss Heavens shook completely, and countless people were shocked.&nbsp;</p><p>"What...what is this Sendai Heavenly List?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Heavens...other worlds??? Little Sendai?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Only the top ten can enter the list. Does this mean that all the young and top-notch forces of the Nine Abyss Heavens have entered the list?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Is the Nine Abyss Heavens going to change?"&nbsp;</p><p>Shouts of shock and surprise could be heard from every direction. No one could have imagined that this day would come, especially when they saw who made the list. Everyone couldn't help but anticipate who would be first on the list.&nbsp;</p><p>As the entire Nine Abyss Heavens shook, the Sendai Heavenly List continued to be announced. However, when the Sixth Place was announced, the entire Nine Abyss Heavens shook once more and everyone was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>"What's going on??!" 
"Soo... Soo Changqing is only sixth?!" 
"No way? He's the strongest Saint Son of the Dao Yi Holy Land. How can he rank sixth?!" 
"Then... who are the monsters ahead of him?!" 
"This can't be right. No matter what, Soo Changqing shouldn't have this rank!" 
"Is it a mistake? Or is Soo Changqing just famous, but not that powerful?" 
"It seems... that's actually possible..." 
Everyone was stunned when they saw Soo Changqing's name announced. In their minds, he should be at least in the top three of the Saint Sons. But now, he's only sixth?! 
Meanwhile, at the Imperial Palace of the Great Feather Dynasty, Su Qingyun suddenly looked shocked, staring at the sky above. 
"This... the Small Immortal Ranking has finally reappeared after ten thousand years?!" 
He breathed heavily and then swallowed hard, not out of fear, but because he was worried about the real chaos that was coming. 
By then, the Nine Xuan Heaven would no longer be peaceful! 
According to the historical records of the Great Feather Dynasty, the appearance of the Small Immortal Ranking would trigger a period of chaos in the Nine Xuan Heaven! 
Beside him, Su Yuwei's eyes widened, taking a cold breath. 
"The Small Immortal Ranking... It's really appeared!!!" 
"But something in Father's memory isn't quite right. There are branches of the Small Immortal Ranking in the countless worlds, not just in the Nine Xuan Heaven!" 
"Soo Changqing is too amazing. He knows so much about the future that what he says is true!!!" 
She was stunned and her heart was beating faster. 
Now that the Small Immortal Ranking has appeared, only the top ten most outstanding geniuses in the Nine Xuan Heaven can be listed on it. 
However, when Su Yuwei saw Soo Changqing's name appear in sixth place... 
She was confused, wasn't he supposed to be ranked second or first? 
At the moment, in the Dao Yi Holy Land... 
"What in the world is the Small Immortal Ranking?" 
Everyone was staring at the Small Immortal Ranking in the sky, their mouths dry. 
The sudden appearance of the ranking made them all confused. 
But what shocked them the most was that moment when Soo Changqing's name was revealed! 
Looking at the sixth position... 
Everyone in the Dao Yi Holy Land was dumbfounded, their eyes almost popping out of their sockets! 
"How... how is this possible?!!"</p><p>"Sixth place for the Holy Son? Impossible, absolutely impossible!!"
"This ranking is flawed. With the Holy Son's strength, he should easily be in the top three, but he's only sixth??"
"This doesn't make sense. How could this ridiculous ranking be determined!?"
"The Holy Son has reached the level of a Saint and even broke through recently, yet he's only sixth?"
"..." 
In an instant, many disciples murmured in disbelief at what they saw. 
They didn't approve of Su Changqing's ranking!
He was their Holy Son, the strongest in history, yet he was only sixth. No one from the Dao Yi Holy Sect could accept it! Although the appearance of the Heavenly Genius Ranking shocked them, they remained quite dissatisfied with this ranking. 
At this moment, on the Saintess Peak, a slender figure gazed at the resplendent Heavenly Genius Ranking in the sky. Ling Qianxue's eyes were full of shock, her heart overwhelmed with disbelief. "Is this really happening!?" 
She was stunned by the Heavenly Genius Ranking that Su Changqing had mentioned in his diary, which had actually been released and ranked. But, 
She was now incredibly confused about her Senior Brother's ranking. Shouldn't he be ranked higher or #1? Why is he only sixth?? 
After taking a deep breath, Dang Ling Qianxue looked in the direction of the Holy Son's Peak, her breathing agitated. "Senior Brother... What's going on with this ranking?" 
"He shouldn't be only sixth!" 
"Is it possible that Senior Brother's strength isn't as strong?" 
After murmuring to herself, she quickly shook her head. Even if there were people stronger than Senior Brother, it wouldn't be so many of them! Sixth place was indeed too low in her eyes! 
What exactly is going on here?

            <p>Chapter 4: Xia Yilin is Confused, What Are You Saying!&nbsp;</p><p>Xia Yilin stared at Su Changqing in shock, "What...what are you saying?"&nbsp;</p><p>"We have only just met, where did this talk of the battle between the heavens come from?" Su Changqing replied, confused as well.&nbsp;</p><p>He had no idea what Su Changqing was talking about. It all made no sense to him. Had he ever even met Su Changqing before? Impossible!&nbsp;</p><p>However, Su Changqing was lost in his own thoughts and didn't pay any attention to Xia Yilin. "Never mind, you are not the same person you were back then. You will understand in the future. For now, you are too weak. Train hard. Just because you walked the invincible road of the Nine Xuan Heaven, it doesn't mean anything. Greater horror awaits in the future!" he said, with a self-deprecating smile.&nbsp;</p><p>Xia Yilin was already going crazy by the time Su Changqing finished speaking. He was staring at him intently, hoping to make sense of what he had just heard. "What are you even talking about? I don't understand anything!" he exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>But Su Changqing didn't say anything else. He just turned around and left the dojo.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Mu Rong Die Yi watched Su Changqing return, looking weary and worn out. She was shaken by his words. "What has Su Changqing gone through in the past to become so jaded? Even though he doesn't recognize me, he still remembers and mourns...," she thought to herself. &nbsp;</p><p>In her mind, whatever Su Changqing had said was true. She didn't doubt it for a second and was lost in thought.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Xia Yilin was infuriated and back at the Northern Ming Holy Land. He kept staring at Su Changqing across the way, "Damn it, how did he know my moves? This is definitely not right!"&nbsp;</p><p>"If he didn't know my moves, I wouldn't have lost so embarrassingly."&nbsp;</p><p>"Most importantly, his mental state seems a bit off. He was mumbling and talking to himself about knowing me and saying things that no one could make sense of."&nbsp;</p><p>"What a strange guy..."&nbsp;</p><p>He looked at Xia Qingxuan and the Northern Ming Three Elders while trying to explain. He wanted to conceal the embarrassment of his defeat. But he couldn't figure out how Su Changqing knew his moves, and this was bothering him.</p><p>The crowd agreed and nodded seriously. But... Xia Qingxuan looked confused yet her mind was stirred up with a storm of shock. "Is everything revealed in Su Changqing's diary true?" Her scalp felt numb and she kept seeing the contents of the diary and the things Su Changqing said to his brother. Will the battle of the worlds truly break out in the future? Everything felt too unreal. Xia Qingxuan continued to think, "If it's true then why didn't he come to me? Or is it because he can't face me?" Her mind was scattered and her inner shock was growing stronger. Although she felt it was unreal, Su Changqing not only knew his brother's nickname but also his father's gun technique like the back of his hand! How could this be fake? But with this, "Am I going to be his..." Xia Qingxuan's face turned hot, her heart racing. In this moment, her shock grew even greater! Because if things really do turn out like this, the war of destruction, the battle of the worlds and even the dark turmoil that causes Su Changqing to fight until all hope is lost will all happen in the future! What kind of world will the future be?? At the same time, Su Changqing reminisced, looking at Xia Yilin who was staring at him. "Check Xia Qingxuan's trust value," he communicated with the system, feeling hopeful. [Northern Ming Holy Land Saintess Xia Qingxuan-Trust Value: !] Seeing the system's message, Su Changqing was quite satisfied. It was truly useful. "Not bad, not bad." He chuckled to himself, having fooled not only Xia Qingxuan but also her brother. This was quite good for him. Looking at Xia Yilin, he did not care whether the latter believed him or not. If he believed, it would be the best for Su Changqing because, according to the original text, this kid will achieve great things in the future. He will shine in the war of destruction! But as he kept looking, a notification from the system sounded in his mind. [Ding! The system is detecting... Detection complete... Name: Xia Yilin! Identity: Northern Ming Holy Lord's Son! Encounter: Attained the Saint realm despite not having suitable techniques. If it remains this way, cultivation will be difficult to improve! Note: This person lacks a high-grade thunder-attribute immortal technique. Host can now invest!] Su Changqing's eyes lit up. "I knew it!" He confirmed his suspicion! As long as he helps Xia Yilin solve this problem, then this kid will definitely be useful to him in the future.</p><p>The antagonist in the original text is a remarkable one and has a high probability of being a good investment! By investing in him, one could win his favor and also make Xia Qingxuan believe in the diary more. It's a win-win situation!&nbsp;</p><p>However, among the people of Beiming Shengdi, Xia Yilin was getting fed up with Su Changqing's gaze and expression. "Damn, why does this guy keep looking at me? We have never met before, yet he said those things to me and even called me by my nickname. I hate it when people call me that!"&nbsp;</p><p>"I can't take it anymore. I want to fight him again!" he exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>He felt extremely uncomfortable under Su Changqing's gaze, as if his father was looking at him. Without hesitation, he wanted to rush out.&nbsp;</p><p>Xia Qingxuan frowned and coldly exclaimed, "Stop!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Sis..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Are you even his match? You'll just embarrass yourself," Xia Qingxuan scolded.&nbsp;</p><p>"...," Xia Yilin looked at his angry elder sister and hung his head, feeling wronged. Since he was young, he had feared his sister the most.&nbsp;</p><p>But soon, everyone at Beiming Shengdi was surprised to see Su Changqing slowly approaching them. Was he coming to see her?&nbsp;</p><p>"What should I do?" Xia Qingxuan was quite nervous and didn't know how to deal with Su Changqing.&nbsp;</p><p>After a while, she realized that she had misunderstood him. Su Changqing just smiled at her and then walked past her to stand in front of Xia Yilin, who looked wary.&nbsp;</p><p>"Tiedan, you don't have a suitable attribute for your own cultivation method. Maybe there is one, but you probably don't like those ordinary cultivation methods. This is the Wuxiang Qianlei, a fairy-level thunder attribute cultivation method which should be suitable for you," he said, his voice light and pleasant. He then raised his hand and revealed an ancient cultivation method book filled with thunder and lightning, exuding an astonishing aura.&nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>P.S.

            <p>Chapter 1: Declaration of War by Undead Demons, Never Give Up?!&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, in the westernmost part of the Jiuxuan Sky, in a desolate land at the northern tip, the Undead Demon Tribe had been rooted here for hundreds of thousands of years. This region was different from other places in that the sky was always gloomy with dark clouds, giving off a dead and lifeless feeling. Especially in the center of the desert, there was an incredibly dense and terrifying demonic aura. Countless demonic creatures infested the area, emitting a chilling atmosphere everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>At the center stood a huge and ancient demon city, a sacred place of the demon tribe and the location of a massive ancestral temple surrounded by a large number of jade plaques. These plaques were made by each demon from birth, by incorporating their soul and blood into the jade, fashioning their personal life plaques. If these plaques were to break, it would represent the death of a younger generation of the demon tribe.&nbsp;</p><p>The central area housed the life plaques of the demon tribesmen who had achieved higher status and positions. In front of these plaques, a middle-aged man with a weathered expression said slowly, "The emergence of the Tian Jiao Bang and the great battle of the world, how can we not have the Undead Demon Tribe? Yuan has entered the world for the first time and placed in the top five of the Tian Jiao Bang, ranking fourth. He has the bloodline of the Demon Emperor, with a chance to awaken to a pure bloodline. I hope that he can lead the demon tribe to once again show their dominance and strength of thirty thousand years ago!" He spoke with a look of contentment on his face. &nbsp;</p><p>He was the leader of the Undead Demon Tribe, the current chief! Xiang Jun! Suddenly, a cracking sound of a life plaque rang out. At first, Xiang Jun didn't pay much attention to it, but seeing a crack in Xiang Yuan's life plaque in front of him, his pupils shrank! "Yuan!" He breathed heavily, wondering if his son was threatened with a life-threatening danger. Didn't Geng Mohan go with him? It was just a grand event in the southern region. How could there be problems while being guarded by the five supreme heaven protectors?&nbsp;</p><p>In an instant, Xiang Jun's expression turned serious, and he was about to move. "Crack... Crack..." However, before he could leave, the life plaque of Xiang Yuan shook violently, with more and more cracks appearing until it completely shattered! Seeing this, his mind went blank! Did his son's life plaque just break like that? Moreover, his drop of blood hadn't been saved! This meant that he had died! &nbsp;</p><p>In that moment, there was a thunderous sound in Xiang Jun's mind, and his face turned pale.</p><p>éå¨ï¼éä¹ï¼ä¸è¡å¼ºå¤§çè½éæ¶å¥åé§çä½åï¼ä»æ¨å«ä¸å£°ï¼æ´ä¸ªäººç¬é´å´©æºèç­ã&nbsp;</p><p>The next heir to the Immortal Demon Clan is destined to perish!? A terrifying aura, far beyond the Supreme Realm, suddenly erupted from Xiang Jun's body, causing the entire hall to shake violently and the sky to thunderous booms. "Who could it be!?" he howled to the sky, causing even the heavens and earth to shudder.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as Xiang Jun's rage and murderous intent were about to explode uncontrollably, a crisp sound echoed through the air, leaving him momentarily stunned. Geng Mohan's nameplate had been destroyed! In his dying moments, Geng Mohan's blood contained a vision of a holy master and Su Changqing of the Dao One Sect!&nbsp;</p><p>"Is the Dao One Sect really going to declare war on the Immortal Demon Clan!?" Although the vision was fleeting and Geng Mohan's blood dissipated, Xiang Jun finally realized who was responsible. "The Dao One Sect!?" His eyes turned bloodshot, and his terrifying aura was no less than that of the holy master of the Dao One Sect!&nbsp;</p><p>Yuan Child, killed by Su Changqing, a prince of the Dao One Sect!? In an instant, the entire demon clan trembled, and above the sky, Xiang Jun's huge virtual image appeared, and his eyes became murderous and solidified. "Dao One Sect!!!" he roared fiercely, causing the world to turn pale and the earth to quake, and the entire Nine Xuan Heaven to shake.&nbsp;</p><p>In this moment of Nine Xuan Heaven, be it the West Desert, the North Wilderness, the East Wasteland or the Central Plains...anywhere you looked, you could see the huge virtual image of Xiang Jun, and hear his deafening roar like a millions of thunder. In an instant, countless people's scalp numbed and their faces turned pale. Why was the Immortal Demon Clan's patriarch so angry!? What exactly happened!? What did the Dao One Sect do in the Southern Domain!? Many doubts arose in everyone's mind!&nbsp;</p><p>Before everyone could react to this astonishing revelation, another virtual image appeared on the sky, almost covering the entire sky, surrounded by a mist that made it difficult to discern the face.&nbsp;</p><p>But...this was the holy master of the Dao One Sect! At this moment, the sky seemed to become the arena of a contention between the two top powerhouses of the Nine Xuan Heaven! Faced with the furious Xiang Jun, the Holy Master of the Dao One Sect showed his coldness and said in a hoarse voice, "Kill my son, destroy my clan's supreme leader, you...ask for death!!!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Today, give me an explanation, Su Changqing must die, otherwise..." However, before he could finish his words, the Holy Master of the Dao One Sect snorted coldly, and a powerful force surged into Xiang Jun's body. With a miserable scream, he was instantly destroyed, body and soul.</p><p>The explosion was deafening, as if filled with fear. 
"What if we do not comply?" 
"Your son brought this upon himself. I am simply giving him what he wants. There is no wrong in that." 
"If there is a next time, I, as the leader of the Dao Yi Holy Sect, will personally lead my disciples to the Western Desert and wipe out your entire clan!" 
His domineering voice shook the heavens and the earth. 
Upon hearing this, Xiang Jun's pupils shrank, but a smile crept onto his face. 
"Good, good..." 
"From this day on, the Undead Clan will not rest until the Dao Yi Holy Sect is destroyed!" 
His eyes turned ice-cold and he spoke through gritted teeth. 
The anger in his heart burned hotter than ever before. He had not expected that the Dao Yi Holy Sect would disregard their threat entirely, not even caring if war broke out. 
As one of the top holy sites in the Southern Domain and a ruler of the entire Nine Mysterious Heavens, Xiang Jun had heard of their rise to power over 10,000 years ago as a new force. But due to the fact that the Undead Clan had been in hiding for so long, he didn't feel confident enough to go to war against them. 
"This is an unforgivable offense!" 
Leaving these words behind, his figure vanished from sight. 
Witnessing this, the Dao Yi Holy Lord sneered, "I am ready to face you at any time!" His own figure disappeared shortly after. 
Only then did the Nine Mysterious Heavens breathe a sigh of relief, but... 
After learning the ins and outs of the situation, countless people were stunned! 
The Dao Yi Holy Sect had just gone to war with the Undead Clan? 
Especially with the fact that Dao Yi Holy Son Su Changqing had killed the Undead Clan's son, the fourth-ranked individual on the Heavenly Pride Ranking list?! 
Oh my god!!! 
The entire Nine Mysterious Heavens erupted in chaos. 
No matter where you went or what you were doing, almost everyone knew about this. 
"Su Changqing? Again? He killed the Undead Clan's young patriarch, the fourth-ranked on the Heavenly Pride Ranking list?!" 
"He's just ranked sixth on the Heavenly Pride Ranking, but he not only defeated the top five, but also killed the strongest of the younger generation of the Undead Clan, who has the bloodline of the Undead King? How terrifying is his strength?!" 
"Was that the Dao Yi Holy Lord just now? The Undead Clan definitely won't let this go. It seems like a war is truly inevitable!"

            <p>Chapter One: Sweeping the Five Great Prodigies, You Call This the Saint Realm?&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Su Changqing did not appear, but attacked directly!&nbsp;</p><p>"Boomâ¦â¦"&nbsp;</p><p>A huge palm directly pressed down on the people outside the holy land!&nbsp;</p><p>The entire sky was shaking, and there were signs of collapse in the void!&nbsp;</p><p>The terrifying aura of the Saint Realm covered the entire world!&nbsp;</p><p>In almost an instant, the people from various forces such as the Xuanming Holy Land and the Hidden Dragon Temple had a big change in their faces!&nbsp;</p><p>"!!!"&nbsp;</p><p>They didn't even have the idea of resisting, because the power of the Saint Realm was not something they could resist!&nbsp;</p><p>A huge palm that covered the sky and sun slowly covered everyone's head.&nbsp;</p><p>"Pu...... Pu......"&nbsp;</p><p>People with insufficient cultivation, their faces turned pale, their bodies trembled violently, and they spit out blood!&nbsp;</p><p>Even the top five prodigies were startled!&nbsp;</p><p>"He... he's targeting the five of us!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"So arrogant!!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing... an excellent Su Changqing!!"&nbsp;</p><p>Jiuyou, Wang Teng, and Sima Chen all had a change in expression, but their eyes were all full of arrogance!&nbsp;</p><p>The sixth-ranked person took the initiative to attack the top five?&nbsp;</p><p>Especially after seeing this destructive posture, he wanted to face the five of them with his own strength!!&nbsp;</p><p>But that astonishing momentum and terrifying pressure...&nbsp;</p><p>Made several people's heartbeats accelerate, and their expressions became solemn!&nbsp;</p><p>"How could he, who is ranked sixth, have such shocking means!?"&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the increasingly calm large palm, they couldn't help but feel a sense of fear!&nbsp;</p><p>After a moment of shock, Jiuyou's eyes flickered with a cold light, and he suddenly attacked!&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't believe that you, a sixth-ranked person..."&nbsp;</p><p>He directly rushed towards the giant palm above his head, but his expression suddenly changed!&nbsp;</p><p>Because...&nbsp;</p><p>As he approached, he felt a breath that made his soul tremble!&nbsp;</p><p>That, that was supreme!?&nbsp;</p><p>Before Jiuyou could react, his body couldn't move, and he trembled constantly!&nbsp;</p><p>"Pu..."&nbsp;</p><p>He couldn't hold back anymore, and suddenly spit out a mouthful of blood, his face pale!&nbsp;</p><p>The aura of the supreme, this was the aura of the supreme!!!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment,&nbsp;</p><p>Jiuyou's mind was blank, and he fell to the ground with serious injuries!&nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing... he... he..."&nbsp;</p><p>He spoke difficulty, but couldn't say anything!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, his whole body was shaking, and he spit out another mouthful of blood!&nbsp;</p><p>This scene immediately made the people of Xuanming Holy Land full of fear!&nbsp;</p><p>Their saint, even before launching an attack, received such a heavy blow!?&nbsp;</p><p>And this scene...</p><p>were left stunned, along with the other four of the top five ranked individuals. 
"How is this possible?!" They exclaimed. 
"What did Su Changqing do?!" 
Their faces became more serious as they looked up at the huge hand that seemed to dominate everything and kept pressing down on them. 
Just as the group was about to make a move, the ground began to shake intensely. 
Boom! Boom! Boom! 
Accompanied by the hand's descent, the earth seemed to be collapsing! 
Gorges spread out in all directions, becoming more and more terrifying with every passing moment. Mountain peaks were unable to withstand such extreme force, crumbling into nothingness! 
With cultivation levels of Saint level and below, not even the weak God kings were exempt from vomiting blood and being unable to move! 
"How is this possible?!" They all collapsed to the ground, struggling to lift their heads as they watched the huge hand approach them. 
Wasn't Su Changqing, the Saint of Dao Yi Sect, ranked only sixth? 
How could the attack be so terrifying? 
Especially for Sima Chen and others who had originally planned to attack, their faces began to change drastically when the hand descended. 
"That hand...it containsâ¦supreme power!" 
"What?! How is that possible? He...isn't he only a Saint level!" 
Despite being the most talented and brilliant individuals in their respective forces, they were now scared out of their wits! 
Others may not know the terrifying aura emanating from the hand, but they were aware of it all too well. 
The immense hand that Su Changqing had created contained a supreme power almost sufficient to scare them to death! 
Even if they stepped into the Saint level, in essence, they were powerless to resist! 
The gap between a Saint level and a supreme power was an abyss that could never be bridged! 
Even if it were ten Saint level individuals attacking, they couldn't kill a supreme power! 
On the contrary, a supreme power could easily crush ten Saint levels like ants! 
Below a supreme power, all were nothing but insignificant ants! 
However, how could Su Changqing, only a Saint level disciple, have access to supreme power? 
At this moment... 
These few individuals were no longer as confident and determined as they had been earlier. Their falsely calm expressions were now full of fear! 
"No...This can't be possible!!!" 
They had never heard of a Saint level person being able to wield the power of a supreme being! 
How could they fight back now? 
Even their pride and fighting spirit had vanished under this aura! 
At this moment, the huge hand came crashing down, bringing with it the aura of destruction that could obliterate the heavens and earth. 
In the terrifying uproar, anyone who had not arrived in this Holy Land was now vomiting blood and passing out. The weaker ones were even directly knocked out cold! 
As for Sima Chen, Wang Teng and others, even if they tried their hardest to resist, they were completely helpless.</p><p>"The huge palm could not be stopped for a moment! 
"Poof!" 
At the same time, they all spewed out a mouthful of blood, their bodies bending and shaking under the terrifying pressure! 
At this moment, they were completely panicked! 
If Su Changqing wanted to kill them, there was no problem!!! 
The intense life and death crisis surged in their hearts, even the top five of the Tianjiao list felt fear in their hearts towards Su Changqing! 
Is this really the means that can be displayed by a Holy Land realm?!!! 
Until Sima Chen and others were pale, unable to withstand it and kneeling on one knee to support themselves... 
The huge palm then disappeared without a trace! 
... 
"Bang! Bang! Bang..." 
The several people who originally begged for mercy now felt their bodies lightened and fell to the ground! 
Everyone's eyes were full of horror, and their hearts were almost jumping out of their throats! 
Watching Su Changqing single-handedly suppress the top five on the list, 
At this moment, everything was silent! 
Most people had already passed out and couldn't bear it, and some people who had breathed a sigh of relief fell down! 
"Hoo...hoo..." 
The sound of rapid breathing rose and fell on the scene. 
Everyone was already sweating profusely, looking at the Holy Son Peak where Su Changqing was located in the Dao Yi Holy Land! 
"Su Changqing... is he... really just in the Holy Land realm?!" 
"He...he single-handedly suppressed the top five on the list!!!" 
"Is Su Changqing still human? How did he do this?!!!" 
"Holy Son... Holy Son he..." 
Not only the outsiders who came to the Dao Yi Holy Land, but even the disciples of the Dao Yi Holy Land were completely stunned and sweating profusely! 
The terrifying blow just now made them feel that death was so close, as if they had set foot in the gate of the ghost!!! 
...

            <ns0:content type="html">
            <p>In the world of Nine Mystical Realms, there exists a sect called Dao Yi Holy Sect. The peak of this mountain belongs to the contemporary holy son, and it emits a radiant glow. The top of the mountain is like two rising suns, dazzling and magnificent, rendering it difficult for one to look straight at it. Furthermore, the entire mountain range is located in the best feng shui spot of the Dao Yi Holy Sect, where it can absorb the essence of the sun and the moon and contain abundant spiritual energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside the mansion on the mountain top, Su Changqing suddenly opened his eyes and gasped for air. Memories flooded his mind. He had... traveled through time! Moreover, he had become a villain in the novel he had previously read, called Nine Mystical Heavens. He became the holy son of the Dao Yi Holy Sect!&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Changqing was in disbelief and opened his mouth wide. He looked around and saw the surroundings that were exactly the same as described in the novel. This strengthened his belief that he had indeed traveled through time. He had such a deep impression of this novel, which was basically a light-hearted one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The plot was brainless, and the storyline was terrible. The main character was helped by an old man coincidentally and rose to fame in no time. However, the plot was so ridiculous that Su Changqing could remember it very clearly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the character he had traveled into was the holy son of the Dao Yi Holy Sect, who was once in a millennium, with exceptional talent and resources that were literally the repository of the entire sect! Many elders and even the sect leader had high regard for him, and he was exceptionally gifted in cultivation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But how could such a powerful individual with such a background be defeated by the main character? Su Changqing simply could not understand it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a while, Su Changqing's facial muscles twitched, and he took a deep breath. "So, I am now the holy son of the Dao Yi Holy Sect!?" Accepting the fact that he had traveled through time, he decided to make the best of it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then his eyes lit up. Since he was now the holy son of the Dao Yi Holy Sect, what did he care about the main character? Suppress the main character? That was out of the question! What is his present status? The main character is just an insignificant bug.</p>
<p>I don't need to pay attention to him!</p>
<p>"If I remember correctly, the protagonist is now on his way to enter in the Dao Yi Sect? After entering the sect, he will rise quickly with the help of the old man and soon compete for the position of the holy son... But now that I am in this position, the protagonist is just an ant, needing to be suppressed?" he muttered to himself, unable to help but sneer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Protagonist? He could just ignore him and not bother with a brainless plot! His own normal development was inevitable and would lead to him achieving the ultimate title of Great Emperor &ndash; wouldn't that be great? Suddenly, a mechanical voice sounded in his head:</p>
<p>[Ding! Fiction Diary System activated!]&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Golden finger??? "</p>
<p>He shuddered, his eyes shining. But... Fiction Diary System??? What did that mean? The system quickly provided an explanation...</p>
<p>[Ding! As the host, you only need to fabricate a diary entry and make others believe it. You will receive rewards for a successful investment. Currently, the holders of Diary Copies are... First, the Dao Yi Sect Saintess &ndash; Ling Qianxue! Second, the Ghost Sea Witch &ndash; Murong Dieyi! Third, the Great Feather Princess &ndash; Su Youwei!]</p>
<p>[Note: The host is the diary's sole chronicler. When the diary is upgraded, other characters will be added!]&nbsp;</p>
<p>After listening, Su Changqing completely understood the system's purpose and looked a little surprised.</p>
<p>"Who writes a diary seriously?" He muttered strangely, but soon found himself shocked.</p>
<p>In other words, he could fabricate the diary's content any way he wanted? As long as he could make the holder of the diary's copy believe what he wrote, he would receive rewards, including the ability to invest with a possible critical strike return?&nbsp;</p>
<p>He carefully thought about it and realized that even a serious person would need to write a diary!</p>
<p>"Ling Qianxue, Murong Dieyi, Su Youwei... Oh my god, they are all the major heroines in the book!" He took a deep breath and his eyes shone brightly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ling Qianxue, the Dao Yi Sect Saintess, has talent that matched Su Changqing's, with the Ice Soul Divine Body that is renowned throughout the entire Dao Yi Sect. At a young age, she had reached the level of a God-King sixth stage and would even compete with him for the title of future holy lord of the Dao Yi Sect, and even the youngest holy lord in the entire Nine Mystical Realm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the Ghost Sea Witch, Murong Dieyi, she was also incredibly strong, residing in the most mysterious area of the Nine Mystical Realm &ndash; the Ghost Sea. She passed the brutal and terrifying selection process to become the sect's witch and achieved fame for her accomplishments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Su Youwei, the princess holding the Great Feather title, is the daughter of the Great Feather Emperor. She was born with a unique phenomenon as an ancient divine phoenix appeared and left its imprint on her forehead. She is also greatly favored by the emperor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And most importantly...&nbsp;All the heroines are potential powerhouse characters, destined for greatness.</p>
<p>If he could fabricate his diary in such a way that they believed it, he would gain rewards and possibly increase his chances of achieving his own ultimate goal &ndash; becoming the greatest in the world!</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, Su Changqing couldn't help but feel excited about how to create the contents of the diary.</p>

            <p>Chapter One: Princess Dayu, also known as Su Youwei, is Su Changqing's companion on the path of cultivation!&nbsp;</p><p>When Ling Qianxue read the last sentence of the diary, she trembled and an icy chill spread around her body. She was going to become Su Changqing's companion on the path of cultivation? This couldn't be possible!&nbsp;</p><p>She felt a tingling sensation on her scalp and her mind went blank. "This diary must be fake!" she thought. She felt like Su Changqing was playing a trick on her. She couldn't believe that she would be interested in him. All she wanted was to focus on her own cultivation. However, she had been facing a bottleneck recently and her progress was slow.&nbsp;</p><p>But what really made her frustrated was the fact that Su Changqing's diary stated that she would be his companion on the path of cultivation. "But... his diary doesn't seem to be fake," she thought to herself. She took a deep breath and her heart rate accelerated. Could this be true?&nbsp;</p><p>She felt a wave of embarrassment as she imagined being Su Changqing's companion on the cultivation path. Just then, the content on the diary updated again.&nbsp;</p><p>"I never thought that my first companion on the path of cultivation would be Ling Qianxue, the holy maiden from my sect. It was a few years later when we were on a mission and she got lost in a misty area. I couldn't just leave her there and we had no choice but to spend the night together. After that, we became husband and wife. Since then, Qianxue has become a different person and she even blushes when she sees me. Our love has remained strong for over thirty years, even though there were many who didn't believe our relationship. Finally, the sect held our wedding and we vowed to be by each other's side for the rest of our lives."&nbsp;</p><p>As Ling Qianxue read the updated content, she was in shock. "What... what is this? Is it really true that I am a companion of Su Changqing?" she thought. She couldn't believe that she had accidentally become his wife during their mission. It seemed impossible!&nbsp;</p><p>However, the thought of a different side of Su Changqing made her heart race. She felt angry and frustrated at this unexpected news. She just had to find out what was going on.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is unbelievable!" she said to herself, gritting her teeth.</p><p>Why is this happening? 
No way! 
This guy actually said he would sacrifice himself!? 
He has no shame!!! 
As for the contents of the diary at this time, Ling Qianxue's breathing became rapid, and her whole face became hot. 
"Qianxue...he...he called me Qianxue..." 
She looked down and saw that her name had been changed in the diary! 
And even later... 
She and Su Changqing announced their relationship to the outside world, causing a stir in the Nine Xuan Heaven? 
Come to think of it, the Dao Yi Sheng Sect is one of the most powerful sects in the Nine Xuan Heaven, how could the outside world stay calm when the Holy Son and the Holy Daughter are together? 
But... 
Will she really walk together with Su Changqing in the future? 
Will the sect even hold a wedding for them? 
And will they make a vow to always be together? 
At this moment, apart from shock, Ling Qianxue's whole face had turned red. 
"He...he...he...me..." 
She was at a loss for words and didn't know how to express her feelings. 
Su Changqing was perfect, incredibly perfect! 
It's not impossible to become Dao companions, but...could it really be like this? 
So far, she still finds it hard to believe. 
... 
In the Great Feather Dynasty, inside a room. 
Su Yuwei was absorbed in reading the updated diary, her face full of surprise. 
"Will the future really be affected by darkness and chaos, causing the collapse of the heavens and turmoil among all creatures?" 
"If that's the case, it's too frightening!!!" 
She was still thinking about what she had read about the future, and was not interested in the ordinary content currently being updated by Su Changqing. 
But before she could think much more, her eyes widened! 
"Ling Qianxue... became Su Changqing's Dao companion?!" 
Her mouth opened wide, and her cute big eyes kept blinking. 
This... 
Is this even real? 
Even... 
The Dao Yi Sheng Sect held a wedding for the two of them? 
These two people... 
A Holy Son and a Holy Daughter, are actually together in this way!? 
Oh my god! 
If this kind of news gets out, it will definitely cause a sensation in the Nine Xuan Heaven within a day! 
At this moment, Su Yuwei's eyes suddenly lit up, staring straight at the diary copy. 
"What about the rest? What happened after that? Did you two live happily ever after...or not?" 
"I never thought I would learn about the future in this way, this Su Changqing...he must have a lot of secrets, right!?" 
She put her finger to her lips, full of curiosity. 
And it was at this moment that the diary copy...</p><p>The content has been updated again! &nbsp;</p><p>"I am now in love with Qian Xue and we are going strong. However, I have now found my second partner, Princess Su Youwei of the Da Yu Dynasty."&nbsp;</p><p>Upon reading the update, Su Youwei, who was originally just reading about it for fun, showed a shocked expression and even gasped in surprise.&nbsp;</p><p>"What? Me?! What...what do you mean? I am now Su Changqing's partner?!" she exclaimed, her body trembling in disbelief.&nbsp;</p><p>How could this be? She was just reading it for fun and now she finds out she has a relationship with Su Changqing? She couldn't believe it and shook her head continuously, as a sign of denial.&nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing... you're talking nonsense!" she spoke out loud. "We've never even met each other before! How could I possibly become your partner? I don't even know what you look like aside from being the strongest saint in the past century."&nbsp;</p><p>She refused to believe it. It was just impossible. But then, she read on.&nbsp;</p><p>"At the auction of the Da Yu Dynasty, I saw Su Youwei for the first time. I was surprised to see a unique mark on her forehead, which I later discovered was a Phoenix mark. This gave her the power of the Phoenix."&nbsp;</p><p>Upon reading this, Su Youwei went silent. She couldn't believe it. What they said was true. She was now connected to Su Changqing in a way she never expected. &nbsp;</p><p>In other news, the author has completed their work that spans two million words. They have also announced a new book and are seeking support through data, flowers, evaluations, comments, and other kinds of support. The writer is grateful for any kind of support and encouragement.</p>

            <p>Chapter One: Stepping into the Divine Realm! Is this the Power of a Reborn Person?
Divine King, Nine Heavens!
Divine King, Nine Heavens Perfection!
Divine King, Nine Heavens Great Perfection!
Su Changqing's cultivation is rapidly increasing at a terrifying speed!
In less than half an hour...
At this moment, on the peak of the Holy Son Mountain, a terrifying whirlpool of spiritual energy rages like a turbulent river, and the terrifying aura makes disciples with weaker cultivation within the sect pale and fall to the ground!
Even some elders have dry throats!
But just as they were shocked and unable to speak, not knowing what was about to happen...
In the palace on the Holy Son Mountain,
Suddenly, a brilliant golden light broke through the clouds as if it was going straight to the Xian Ting!
For hundreds of miles around, divine light shone!
It was clearly nighttime, yet it was brighter than daylight!
At the same time...
An even more terrifying pressure suddenly descended, shrouding the entire Dao Yi Holy Sect!
This is...
A Saint!!
In an instant, the sect was completely shaken, and everyone was terrified!!!
"The Holy Son...the Holy Son has broken through repeatedly and has now entered the Saint realm?!"
"Saint realm!!!"
"Oh my god...this...this...how is this possible?!"
"No way? In just a short period of time, he has broken through three small realms in succession?!"
"Is this our Holy Son of the Dao Yi Holy Sect...so terrifying?!"
"..."
Whether it was disciples or elders, their bodies were trembling uncontrollably at this moment!
Su Changqing broke through to the Saint realm!
Especially under countless gazes...
In the void at the top of the Holy Son Mountain,
A huge virtual shadow belonging to Su Changqing slowly emerged, with an amazing aura that made the void tremble!
This...
This is the Divine Realm anomaly caused by reaching the Saint realm!
At this moment, the vast majority of disciples couldn't help but fall to the ground, with pale faces, and feeling almost suffocated!
The pressure from Su Changqing made them unable to stand up straight!
Even Elder Ouyang Yan's body was trembling slightly!
"This aura..."
He breathed heavily, looking at Su Changqing's virtual shadow in disbelief!
The Holy Son...
Has become a Saint!!!
...
On the other hand,
On the Holy Daughter Mountain,
At this moment,
Ling Qianxue's aura was strong. She had seen the solution given in Su Changqing's diary, and now she was at the Divine King Seventh Heaven!</p><p>ä¹ä¸å¯»å¸¸çäºæã&nbsp;</p><p>"Suzhang Qing... he... he..." She had no joy on her face, instead showing a shock beyond words. She had just finished seclusion and felt an unusual energy fluctuation on the Holy Son Peak. But she didn't expect that... Suzhang Qing had broken through! And not just one level, but three, reaching the level of a saint one after another!!! In the midst of the stormy waves, Ling Qianxue's delicate body trembled, her eyes filled with disbelief. "How could Suzhang Qing break through in such a way?!" She was shaky and couldn't maintain her usual calm. At this moment, she felt deeply struck. Since achieving the God King Realm, every small level she had advanced took her at least two to three months, and up to half a year. This was already rare in the entire Nine Xuan Heaven! But now, she saw Suzhang Qing break through from the God King realm all the way to the Saint Realm in one fell swoop! She couldn't get her mind off it for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>After taking a deep breath, Ling Qianxue remembered that Suzhang Qing had been reborn, which balanced her inner turmoil somewhat. "I won't compare myself with you, it's impossible!" She couldn't help but stomp her foot, feeling that trying to keep up with Suzhang Qing's footsteps was simply a pipe dream! Since this guy had been reborn in the future ten thousand years later, it must be easy for him to cultivate! But even if she understood the reason behind it, she still felt amazed by Suzhang Qing's continuous breakthroughs! Such a thing was unheard of in the entire Nine Xuan Heaven, from ancient times until now! It's horrifying! Just thinking that Suzhang Qing would be her future husband made Ling Qianxue's face turn red, really hot! "This guy... he's so strong!!!" Even if she was born proud, she had to admit Suzhang Qing's terror now. Especially when she thought that she would become Suzhang Qing's wife in the future, her sense of security was full! Just thinking about it made her body tremble slightly and her face turned even hotter.&nbsp;</p><p>Ling Qianxue's attention was now completely focused on the Holy Son Peak, her thoughts drifting away, completely unaware of the several maidservants beside her.&nbsp;</p><p>"???" The maidservant responsible for taking care of the saint's daily life saw Ling Qianxue's blushing face and became even more dazed! What's going on? The saint's face is red! She... she... she... Afterwards, the others also looked at the Holy Son Peak, where strange phenomena were occurring, and they exchanged looks. "Saint..." Their hearts trembled, as if they had discovered something unusual.</p><p>Wow, this is quite something! &nbsp;</p><p>Oh my god! After all these years, they finally saw a different side of the saintess! When she noticed the strange looks from several maids, Ling Qianxue immediately came to her senses and turned around to leave. "Damn it!" She gritted her teeth, wondering how she could have such thoughts. &nbsp;</p><p>Ah... &nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, outside the Daoist Saint Sect, a handsome young man watched in awe as a blinding light illuminated the whole sky. "What's happening!?" His scalp tingled at the terrifying phenomenon... But soon he realized that the commotion was coming from the Daoist Saint Sect, the target of his journey! Looking around, he saw countless people staring in the same direction. &nbsp;</p><p>There was a towering mountain peak that drew everyone's attention. Lin Fan was surprised by what was happening and murmured, "Master Yu, can you tell what's going on?" "Someone is breaking through... It's the Ninth Heaven of the Divine King!" A hoarse voice came from a withered old man who suddenly appeared from Lin Fan's ring. With this answer, Lin Fan blinked and stared fixedly in the direction of the Daoist Saint Sect. "No wonder it's one of the best places to cultivate in the Nine Heavens... "He couldn't help but yearn to join the Daoist Saint Sect. With Master Yu's help, he could definitely rise up all the way! &nbsp;</p><p>But suddenly, Master Yu's expression changed in surprise and he exclaimed, "This is not right, not right!" "What... What's going on? Why is there suddenly so much power? Divine King Nine Heavens Perfection, Divine King Nine Heavens Great Perfection, Saint... Saint realm!!!" Lin Fan was completely dumbfounded. "What? Someone else can break through like this?" He gasped for breath, then felt the suffocating pressure of a Saint's aura... &nbsp;</p><p>As for the "p:" at the end, it seems to be an announcement about a new book by the author and a plea for support from readers.</p>

            <ns0:content type="html">
            <p>Chapter One: Shu Tan, this is what a villain should look like!
If Su Changqing were present,
he would definitely recognize that Lin Fan is the protagonist in this world!
After being shocked for quite some time,
Lin Fan arrived at the foot of Dao Yi Holy Sect's mountain, looking up at the holy site that countless people were crazy about and wanted to enter.
"Yu Lao, who do you think could have such ability?" he asked the old man, suppressing his inner shock.
Continuous breakthroughs in such a short period of time and entering the realm of the holy sage!
He had never heard of such a thing!
Especially now, the sky within a radius of hundreds of miles was shining with divine light!
The terrifying pressure of the holy sage lingered, making breathing difficult!
Upon hearing this, Yu Lao took a glance at the sky above and then muttered in surprise, "With such momentum and amazing talent, itâs undoubtedly the holy son of Dao Yi Holy Sect, Su Changqing!"
"Besides Su Changqing, I can't think of anyone else in Dao Yi Holy Sect who can have such potential, not even the saintess!" he continued, before looking at Lin Fan beside him.
Regarding Su Changqing, he had already learned about his identity when he woke up.
The strongest holy son of Dao Yi Holy Sect in history, with an extremely excellent talent and almost a collection of thousands of favors. He also had countless resources!
He even had once fantasized about taking him as a disciple, but it was just wishful thinking.
Before Lin Fan could react to what he had heard,
"Holy Son! Holy Son! Holy Son..." Fanatical shouts echoed throughout Dao Yi Holy Sect, making people deafened!
It was also at this moment when,
On the peak of the Holy Son...
Su Changqing's figure soared into the sky, stepping on the void with his white clothes fluttering without wind, and looking particularly dazzling!
"Whoosh..."
With his breath, the wind of the sky and earth raged, and a slight movement of his hand could cause the void to tremble!
The power of a holy sage was undoubtedly revealed, making the world pale!
At this moment, he didn't say a word, but became the focal point of countless people's attention!
This moment, was the most dazzling existence in the world!
It kept the disciples of the whole sect in awe and fanaticism!!!
Along with Su Changqing's appearanceâ¦
Even if Lin Fan only took a glance, his eyes ached and his soul trembled!
"Is this...he is Su Changqing, the holy son of Dao Yi Holy Sect?" he asked, feeling the pressure of the holy sage, his body shaking but trying to suppress it.
This Su Changqing made him feel a pressure that he had never experienced before!
And the other party's identity made him unable to help feeling jealous and envious!
How great it would be if it was him.</p><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath and spoke with difficulty while glancing at Yu Lao beside him. "Su Changqing... I must join the Dao One Holy Sect and step on you as my whetstone in the future!" He was not only envious but also jealous of Su Changqing's status, position, power, and all his resources. If it weren't for Yu Lao's guidance, he might still be an ordinary person and it would even be a luxury to cultivate, let alone match up to Su Changqing.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon hearing Lin Fan's words, Yu Lao was stunned. He looked at Su Changqing, who was receiving wide attention. "What can you compare with him? He's the son of the Dao One Holy Sect, one of the top holy places of the Nine Xuan Heavens. He's the strongest son of saints in history, possessing countless resources, unmatched talents, and unless he stops cultivating, he's impossible to be surpassed. Unless his cultivation suddenly stagnates, how can you ever step on him?"&nbsp;</p><p>Yu Lao sighed at the jealousy in Lin Fan's eyes. If only his disciple could be Su Changqing, he would be willing to make even greater sacrifices without any complaints. &nbsp;</p><p>Half an hour later, everyone in the Dao One Holy Sect was unable to sleep. "He's our son of saints, the strongest in history!!!" "So this is how a saint breakthrough looks like. I'm amazed!" "Such a terrifying son of saints. With his cultivation speed, becoming an Immortal and perhaps a Supreme is just a piece of cake!" "The gap between people is really huge. Some things cannot be achieved by just working hard alone..." &nbsp;</p><p>The images of Su Changqing's breakthrough and amazing speed were constantly flashing in their minds. Less than half an hour, from the God King Realm to the Saint Realm directly? Who in the Nine Xuan Heavens can achieve this feat? Even if there are, it's something in the future! &nbsp;</p><p>Today, Su Changqing is the first! &nbsp;</p><p>While everyone in the sect was still reeling from the shock of Su's breakthrough, he returned to his room, feeling the earth-shattering changes after his breakthrough. "So this is the Saint Realm..." He murmured softly. His body now was filled with strength and power, far stronger than when he was a God King, many times over! Without exaggeration, he could now easily take on three or more perfect God Kings alone, even though he was just in the early stage of the Saint Realm. &nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing reached out and squeezed the void in front of him. "Crack, crack..." The sounds of compression and even fragmentation of the void were heard. Now he had a clearer sense of things than before. This was something that the God King Realm could never match! &nbsp;</p><p>He was ecstatic.</p><p>After experiencing it for a while, Su Changqing was extremely satisfied and even more determined. "From now on, I'll just write in my diary, occasionally act out and tease the female leads to become stronger. It's such a comfortable and enjoyable thing."&nbsp;</p><p>"Why should I follow the brainless storyline from the original work?" &nbsp;</p><p>"What's my identity and position? I'm the Holy Son of Dao One Sect. Why do I need to fight with the male lead or play mind games? It's ridiculous!" He couldn't help but sneer just thinking about it, even mocking the author's portrayal of the female lead as completely brainless. &nbsp;</p><p>Especially himself, as a Holy Son of Dao One Sect. When the male lead began to rise up, Su Changqing was already pondering over how to suppress him, which was simply foolish and made him speechless. &nbsp;</p><p>He didn't want to think about the story anymore. Su Changqing lay comfortably on his luxurious bed, feeling more relaxed than ever. &nbsp;</p><p>After some contemplation, he realized it was important to build trust and shape the images of the three diary owners if he wanted to progress in the future. &nbsp;</p><p>So he did it. Without hesitation, Su Changqing immediately started writing in his diary with his left hand. &nbsp;</p><p>"Once again, broke through to the realm of Saint. But this time, my heart is extremely calm..." &nbsp;</p><p>"If this were in my past life, I would be happy, ecstatic even. Thinking back, I do miss it." &nbsp;</p><p>"The Saint is revered throughout the world... But what does being a Saint mean in the face of the impending crisis? It's just a tiny ant!" &nbsp;</p><p>"In this lifetime, I will strive to climb higher. Forget about the Saints, even if a World Sea sweeps in, even if it's a Supreme, an Emperor, they are all just ants!" &nbsp;</p><p>"Sigh... I still can't forget. Oh well, I won't think about it anymore." &nbsp;</p><p>"That's it for this life. Let it be peaceful, I'm really tired..." &nbsp;</p><p>... &nbsp;</p><p>P.S: The old author's new book is released, and we promise to update frequently with high quality. We kindly request your support with reviews, flower giving, votes, and even comments. Please give the author support, thank you!</p>

            <ns0:content type="html">
            <p>Chapter 1: Ask the Future You, for Today You Shall Die!&nbsp;</p><p>On the scene, amidst a crowd of blank stares, Ling Qianxue's eyes surged with killing intent.&nbsp;</p><p>"Dao Yi Saint Sect doesn't need troublemakers like you!" With the contents of her diary in mind, she once again waved her hand. The whirlwind engulfed everything, and a bone-chilling cold descended, condensing around Ling Qianxue in the form of innumerable ice spikes, which suddenly shot towards Lin Fan.&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Lin Fan's mind went blank, staring in shock at the Dao Yi Saint Sect Saintess who was about to kill him. "Troublemaker? What have I done to become a troublemaker?" He was already seriously wounded from an unexpected attack earlier, and was now frantically dodging the astonishing barrage of ice spikes.&nbsp;</p><p>In his mind, he kept thinking about what he had done to attract the wrath of a Saintess from the Dao Yi Saint Sect. But he had only just met her!&nbsp;</p><p>Just like that, he became a troublemaker?&nbsp;</p><p>Ling Qianxue looked at Lin Fan evading and questioning her, her expression growing colder. "Ask the Future You, for today, I will kill this kind of troublemaker!" she yelled, and once again, countless ice spikes condensed and formed, accompanied by a suffocating aura that affected everyone present.&nbsp;</p><p>Even the disciples of the Dao Yi Saint Sect who came running to the commotion were left dumbfounded at the sight of what was happening.&nbsp;</p><p>"What's wrong with the Saintess? Why...why is she so angry?"&nbsp;</p><p>"What did that guy do?! He's done for now that the Saintess is this angry!"&nbsp;</p><p>Gasps and discussions broke out, but no one dared to intervene, not even the elders.&nbsp;</p><p>Lin Fan was unable to dodge and was impaled by an ice spike through his chest. He coughed up another mouthful of blood and shuddered violently.&nbsp;</p><p>Was this Dao Yi Saint Sect Saintess crazy? And why asking his future self?&nbsp;</p><p>He watched as more and more ice spikes came hurtling towards him. Lin Fan's face grew paler, and his breaths weaker. "Let's talk it out...let's talk it out...please don't kill me!"&nbsp;</p><p>"What did I do to become a troublemaker? I passed the assessment through my own skills, and didn't hurt anyone or cheat. As a Saintess, why would you act against a Ling Hai master like myself?"&nbsp;</p><p>But his pleas fell on deaf ears, as Ling Qianxue remained unaffected, her eyes flashing with an icy blue light.&nbsp;</p><p>"Seal!"&nbsp;</p><p>She uttered a word indifferently, and the void quaked.</p><p>Full of frost!
In the next second, it felt like the world around froze!
The pressure of the Divine King slammed down, thunder cracking in the sky!
Lin Fan's expression drastically changed as he frantically contacted the entity in his ring: "Yu Lao, save me!!!"
"If you keep standing there watching, Iâ¦I'll really die here!" He urged, spitting out blood.
Now, Lin Fan's cultivation level was still too weak, making it impossible for him to contend against his opponent.
Even with decent techniques, all he could do was escape for his life.
As he watched his body stiffen and wait to be pierced by the ice, the ring faintly flickered and let out a sigh.
The next second, a shimmering light enveloped Lin Fan's figure, and he vanished.
Seeing this,
Ling Qianxue furrowed her brow, staring intensely at the spot where Lin Fan disappeared. "Someone's aiding him in secret!?" She took a deep breath, the killing intent not lessening as she coldly spoke, "This person must not enter the Tao One Holy Sect!" "If encountered, kill him!!!" Her voice was extremely cold, making the listeners' hair stand on end. 
Whether it was the elders or disciples present, none of them had any objections, simply nodding in agreement. 
As for Lin Fan, they had already seen how arrogant he was. 
So upon hearing Ling Qianxue's words, they didn't disagree and were even willing to help. 
Meanwhile, dozens of miles outside of Tao One Holy Sect, a dazzling light flashed, revealing Lin Fan's figure after it faded away. 
At this moment, he was no longer as lively and energetic as before but was extremely disheveled, with blood all over his body. 
Lin Fan frightenedly looked in the direction of Tao One Holy Sect, his face pale. 
"What the hell is going on with the Holy Maiden of Tao One Holy Sect?" 
He thought of how he almost died at her hands and spat out another mouthful of blood.
His injuries were severe!
If it weren't for Yu Lao, he probably would have died long ago. 
After taking a moment to calm down, Lin Fan's face became gloomy, gnashing his teeth in hate. 
"The Holy Maiden of Tao One Holy Sectâ¦what a holy maiden!" 
"She's afraid I'll rise in Tao One Holy Sect so she's taken precautions?" 
"The shame today will be repaid a hundredfold in the future!!!" 
"Wait and see, you dog of a Holy Maiden, just wait for me...I'll make you pay in full!"</p><p>One day, "I will step on you and that so-called powerful saint, Su Changqing!!!" His eyes blazed with anger and his body was shaking with fury. At that moment, a soul body appeared from the ring. Elder Yu, looking at Lin Fan who was furious, shook his head and said, "Can you please act more low-key? Being too flashy is not a good thing!" "Elder Yu, I must avenge this grudge!!!" Lin Fan couldn't listen and roared. Seeing Lin Fan lose his mind in anger, Elder Yu was at a loss and could only shake his head. "Why did I choose you?" He sighed in his heart, no longer saying much, and returned to the ring. This kid's talent is okay, but his heart is too impatient and restless, too difficult to teach! Now he didn't want to worry too much and fell silent again. At this time, at the Dao One Sect, Ling Qianxue's actions caused those who wanted to become disciples of Dao One Sect to no longer be as arrogant and wild as Lin Fan before. The situation seemed much more harmonious. The peak of the saints. Su Changqing also learned about Ling Qianxue's actions and even completely wiped out Lin Fan! "Oh..." He laughed, quite satisfied. Look, in the original text of the author, did this villain need to take action personally? Not at all! For Su Changqing, the male lead is just an ant, not worth mentioning! The male lead who hasn't grown up yet? To put it bluntly, he's just a waste! However, Su Changqing was not surprised that Lin Fan had run away, but instead coldly laughed. "The old man in the ring? Can you help him this time, and how many times can you help him?" He shook his head, no longer thinking too much. What he needs to do now is to continue fabricating the diary! Finally, the author announced the release of a new book, promised to update regularly with guaranteed quality, and begged readers to support the novel with flowers, comments, and votes. The message ended with a line of code inviting readers to continue reading the story.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1: The Arrival of the Demon Sect, Diary Continues to Convince!&nbsp;</p><p>The divine palace was like a fairyland, with ethereal and lush spiritual energy that gave off a majestic atmosphere from every corner. The representatives of the major holy sites were already seated, while those who came to attend the ceremony and seek entry into the top holy sites gathered on the giant platform.&nbsp;</p><p>As everyone waited, there was a continuous thunderous sound that made them all tense up. Suddenly, amidst countless gazes, Su Changqing arrived on his unicorn thunder beast, which left lightning trails with every step. He was accompanied by the disciples of the Daoist Holy Sect.&nbsp;</p><p>"I am Su Changqing, the representative of the Daoist Holy Sect, attending the ceremony on behalf of the Holy Master." With a confident smile, he leapt off his beast and slowly took his seat in the Daoist Holy Sect's arena.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone sucked in a breath of astonishment. "This is the Daoist Holy Sect's holy son, Su Changqing?" they thought. "He looks so young, yet he already has the cultivation level of a Triple Heaven Saint!" "What a strong aura!!!" "I really wish I could join the Daoist Holy Sect..."&nbsp;</p><p>They were all amazed by the spectacle presented by the Daoist Holy Sect, with their white-robed and elegant Su Changqing. Even many of the participants of the ceremony were hoping to join the Daoist Holy Sect!&nbsp;</p><p>Facing the buzzing of discussion, the disciples of the Daoist Holy Sect couldn't help but feel proud, gazing at Su Changqing with fanaticism. He was their holy son! Countless people were already going crazy over him, even without any olive branch thrown in their direction. &nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, not far from the Daoist Holy Sect's position was the location belonging to the Tai Xu Holy Land. At the sight of Su Changqing, all Tai Xu disciples' eyes narrowed with alarm. &nbsp;</p><p>"I never thought Su Changqing would come. That guy is terrifying..." "Seeing him in person, his aura is too strong. Just looking at him makes me feel like I am facing a great enemy!" "Relying on your own senses? This person is someone who single-handedly swept through the top five on the original Heavenly Pride List. How many people in the Nine Profound Heavens can do that? "This ceremony is probably the main stage of the Daoist holy sect..."&nbsp;</p><p>They all discussed Su Changqing's appearance, who seemed calm on the surface, but his presence made them all nervous. It had nothing to do with the other factions; mainly, his aura was too strong! Tai Xu's disciple, Ji Yifan, took a deep breath as he watched Su Changqing, "Su Changqing..." he murmured to himself, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p>As a true top talent, Su Changqing is incomparable even though he represents the Tai Xu Sacred Land. Ji Yifan shook his head and admired Su Changqing's achievement, acknowledging that it is exceptional and that it may only be a matter of time before he becomes the Highest or even the Quasi-Emperor. He sighed, feeling that the gap between people is really too big. The disciples of Tai Xu Sacred Land nodded in agreement. &nbsp;</p><p>After half an hour, almost all the holy lands arrived and were observing the assessment of the participating cultivators. Su Changqing's selection for Tai Xu Sacred Land began. He didn't pay much attention to the situation on the field or to other Holy Lands, but he wondered if there were any potential investors. After all, having more subordinates would be a good thing for him. However, at that moment, a loud noise came from the sky above the Divine Palace, and all eyes turned to see a huge dark battleship covered in blood-red markings slowly hovering overhead. They all knew: the Ghost Sea Demon Sect had arrived. &nbsp;</p><p>Everyone couldn't help but speculate and discuss why the Ghost Sea Demon Sect returned after withdrawing from the festival 500 years ago. Some wondered if the new Witch of the Ghost Sea Demon Sect was coming to represent them this time, while others speculated that the Demon Lord wanted to show off a new world-shocking talent. As countless eyes were fixed on the battleship in the sky, figures began to emerge from the ship, each exuding a powerful aura of demonic energy. In front of them was a cold, glamorous girl, dressed in a red dress with purple eyes- it was Mu Rong Die Yi, the new Witch of the Ghost Sea Demon Sect. Her shocking presence left many feeling terrified and trembling.</p><p>"Mo Sect is a sect full of slaughter, adhering to the law of the jungle. I refuse to join Mo Sect no matter what..." "Hehe, weaklings without the mentality of a strong person are different from me. I originally wanted to join another holy land, but now that Mo Sect is participating, I want to try to get a chance to enter Mo Sect!" "..." Amidst the exclamations and discussions, Murong Dieyi slowly landed, converging her magic power, ignoring the others, and staring directly at the location of the Dao One Holy Sect! "Is that... Su Changqing!?" She immediately locked her gaze on Su Changqing, who was also looking at her, dressed in a white robe. It looked perfect! She asked Mo Zhu to come here to see Su Changqing. She came here only for Su Changqing! Looking at the person she longed to see... Murong Dieyi's heartbeat accelerated, she became even more nervous, and there was a fleeting shyness on her face. "Hoo..." She took a deep breath, adjusted her mindset, and walked over. Seeing this, the people present were all puzzled. What did the witch mean? But when Su Changqing saw Murong Dieyi's arrival, he blinked. "Why did the witch come?" He was surprised because in the original text, Mo Sect did not participate in this festival. But now... When he saw Murong Dieyi walking towards him, Su Changqing knew that she was one of the diary holders, and his eyes became deep, full of vicissitudes, and began to fabricate the third diary. [The witch? How did she come!?] [In my past life... Mo Sect did not participate in this festival, why is it different from the past? ] [Could it be that this is the butterfly effect after my rebirth?] [But...] [This is great, the butterfly I most want to see, the one I miss the most, is now in front of me!] [Dieyi, it's really been a long time... ] [But how should I face her? She and Junior Sister are the same now and don't know what will happen to us in the future.] [Forget it, being able to see Dieyi again at this moment is already satisfying!] [Now she is still the witch in people's eyes, still so arrogant, and no different from the one in my memory. It's great.] [Dieyi, this time, I will never let other factors separate us again...]... P: The old author's new book is released, and he will definitely work hard to update it frequently with guaranteed quality! Please support the new book with your data!

            <p>Chapter One: The Tragic Male Lead, Witch's Trust Points Reached the Limit!
At the moment,
Lin Fan was already chased to the point of spitting out blood, and his injuries became more and more serious.
"Damn it!!!!"
No matter how he asked, the witch didn't give any answers.
Even worse, she didn't even bother to lay a hand on him!
The coldness and disgust in her eyes made Lin Fan's scalp numb, and he had no idea why the Mo Sect was watching him.
Ji Yifan looked at the heavily injured Lin Fan, just about to speak...
Suddenly!
A large group of Dao One Holy Sect disciples arrived!
"This person is someone our holy lady named to be killed, and is a wanted person in the Dao One Holy Sect!"
"Attack!"
They loudly voiced out the reason and immediately joined the ranks to kill Lin Fan.
Seeing another group of people coming,
Lin Fan widened his eyes, feeling numb all over his body!
"This!!!!"
His eyes were about to burst, he had no idea that the Dao One Holy sect was also looking for him!
Under the endless pursuit of Mo Sect and Dao One Holy Sect disciples, he couldn't help but spit out blood, even with his great divine powers, he tried his hardest to avoid them!
At this moment, he had no chance to fight back!
Seeing that he could not resist,
Lin Fan immediately looked up at Ji Yifan above the Tai Xu Holy Land, and hurriedly said, "Holy Son, save me!"
Seeing the scene in front of him,
Ji Yifan widened his eyes, and his thoughts of mediation disappeared.
"I can't do anything about this..."
He saw Lin Fan shouting for help, and immediately shook his head.
Even though Tai Xu Holy Land was not weak, they still couldn't afford to offend both the Mo Sect and Dao One Holy sect at the same time.
Moreover, Lin Fan was not even a true disciple of Tai Xu Holy Land.
Seeing that the other party ignored him,
Lin Fan couldn't avoid it and was pierced through his chest by a Dao One Holy Sect disciple's long sword!
"Spit!!!"
His pupils contracted and he spit out another mouthful of blood.
At this moment, his body was extremely weak, and he would undoubtedly die if this continued!
A strong sense of crisis rose in his heart, and he let out an angry roar of frustration!
It was at this moment,
"Boom!!!"
A shocking sound rang out!
In the ring on Lin Fan's hand, Yu Lao had a complex expression and let out a sigh.
"Enough..."
He shook his head helplessly and started to burn his own soul to save Lin Fan!
The next second,
A tremendous aura erupted from Lin Fan's body, and waves of flowing light enveloped him.
"I, Lin Fan, will repay this debt one day!!!"
The next moment, he turned into a bloody light and fled at an extremely high speed!
Because everything happened too suddenly, the disciples of both sects were unable to stop him for a moment, and could only watch helplessly as their target fled!
Seeing this,
"Who exactly is helping himâ½"</p><p>Muran Dieyi furrowed her brows as the terrifying energy had momentarily knocked her out of her senses. By the time she had regained her composure, the enemy had already fled the scene! Amidst the uproar of the crowd, Su Changqing watched Lin Fan, who had been severely injured and had to burn his essence blood just to escape, with a smile on his face. "Brilliant, absolutely brilliant," he said, even clapping his hands in approval. However, he felt that all of this was too simple. Did he really need to get his hands dirty? No. At that moment, Muran Dieyi returned with an unnatural expression. "It's a pity we couldn't kill him, but he's badly injured and the disciples of the Demon Sect have already gone to pursue him," she said, her voice icy. The kill intent in her heart at that moment was overwhelming. She never thought that this guy could still escape! Su Changqing, not too concerned about the situation, said calmly, "Dieyi, don't worry about it. Have a seat." His demeanor was quite gentlemanly. His lack of concern was due to the fact that this guy was the male protagonist in the original novel, and as the son of destiny, it was normal for him not to die. Muran Dieyi, on the other hand, bit her lip, staring at Su Changqing with a slightly red face as she heard him address her so familiarly on their first meeting. "This guy really doesn't care about anything..." she thought to herself as she sat down and took a closer look at Su Changqing. According to reason, Lin Fan was so despicable in the future that no one would be able to remain calm, but Su Changqing was like what he wrote in his diary, with no waves. Suddenly, a copy of the diary appeared before her eyes. "He's just a Lin Fan. I don't care if he lives or dies. Compared to the battle of the future multiverse, what does he count for? At this moment, being able to be with Dieyi and obtain a moment of peace is what I want. In this life, I only hope that there will be no regrets between us. It's great that we don't have to go through the first meeting again. I vaguely recall the first time I met Dieyi, she didn't even ask for explanations before attacking me. Her temper was really explosive. But the longer we were together, the more I realized that Dieyi's heart and her appearance weren't the same. Sometimes, she was quite cute... Dieyi, let's have a good life in this world..." Muran Dieyi blushed hotter and hotter as she looked at the contents of Su Changqing's diary that were being updated in real-time. "This guy...!" She kept her composure on her face, but her heart was filled with sweetness. In the future, she would meet and fall in love with Su Changqing, and it would be one of those situations where they didn't start off well. After finishing reading the diary, Muran Dieyi's face became even redder and her heart beat faster.</p><p>"He...he actually said I'm cute?!?" She blinked and saw Su Changqing turn his head, his eyes avoiding hers. No one had ever said that to her before. Cute? She was a witch, after all! Humph! It seems...her future really will be with Su Changqing! However, at this moment, Su Changqing, who had been interestedly watching the avoiding gaze of Murong Dieyi, heard a notification from the system in his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>[Ding!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Murong Dieyi, the Holy Maiden of the Ghost Sea Demon Sect - Trust Value: !]&nbsp;</p><p>He saw that the witch's trust value had also exceeded the limit, reaching the level of extreme trust. This...needed to be carefully handled! However, didn't the system say before that as long as two diary holders reach the level of extreme trust, a new holder will be unlocked? And in this world, there were more than three female leads. Before Su Changqing could think too much, a sudden gust of wind blew across the sky, with a loud clash of sound! Everyone raised their heads, and the entire expanse of sky was suddenly obscured. They saw a group of long-robed cultivators standing on the backs of giant birds, with powerful auras that made people turn pale. Murong Dieyi squinted her eyes and said to Su Changqing calmly, "These people are from Zhongzhou, the North Sea Sanctuary!" "Why are they here..." she was quite curious, and looked at Su Changqing. Was it because of him? As soon as he heard this, Su Changqing didn't pay attention to it, but stared straight at the noble woman standing in front of the giant bird. "The North Sea Sanctuary... isn't she one of the female leads in the original work!?" "This is not right, there was no such plot in the original!" He felt puzzled. Could it be his fault that caused a chain reaction?... P.S: The author has released a new book, and promises to update regularly and ensure quality!

            <p>Chapter 4: What is it like to turn the male lead into a villain?!&nbsp;</p><p>On the scene, amidst the gasps of the crowd... &nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing narrowed his eyes, staring at Xiang Yuan not far away. &nbsp;</p><p>"It's him..." &nbsp;</p><p>He was somewhat surprised, but at the same time remembered the introduction of Xiang Yuan in the original text. &nbsp;</p><p>Isn't this the good buddy of the male lead in the original work?! &nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, there is a strand of ancient demon emperor blood flowing in Xiang Yuan's body. Although it is not much, it is enough to command a group of demons! &nbsp;</p><p>On the road of cultivation, he has been smooth sailing, and he has no opponents among the young generation of the Undying Demon Clan! &nbsp;</p><p>He just entered the world and defeated the original fourth rank of the Tianjiao List to replace him! &nbsp;</p><p>According to the normal plot development, this guy will also cause chaos in the End of the World War in the future, making the Jiu Xuan Sky even more chaotic! &nbsp;</p><p>As for why the demon clan allowed Xiang Yuan to enter the world, it is because of the current world of the Tianjiao List. &nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the Undying Demon Clan, the Dao Yi Holy Sect to which Su Changqing belongs is the top holy land that has risen in the last ten thousand years, a new giant! &nbsp;</p><p>Even if it is not the first among the major holy lands, compared to pure strength, other holy lands dare not act rashly! &nbsp;</p><p>But why did this guy rush towards him?? &nbsp;</p><p>Thinking of this, a glimmer of amazement flashed in Su Changqing's eyes. Since the opponent is the good brother of the future male lead, isn't it a pity not to fabricate something? &nbsp;</p><p>So he thought of a brilliant idea, a great content to fabricate! &nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly... &nbsp;</p><p>"Boom!!!" &nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing's breath changed drastically, a sense of killing intent erupted, and a trace of anger appeared in his eyes! &nbsp;</p><p>"It's you!!" &nbsp;</p><p>His voice was hoarse, and his expression showed endless vicissitudes of life! &nbsp;</p><p>Immediately, his cultivation of the Triple Heaven of Saints erupted suddenly. The world shook, and the void roared! &nbsp;</p><p>His white long clothes rustled, and the immense killing intent raged throughout the ceremony site! &nbsp;</p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom..." &nbsp;</p><p>When the Saint was angry, the sky and earth changed color! &nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, the scene paled in comparison! &nbsp;</p><p>Everyone saw Su Changqing suddenly burst out with murderous intent. Everyone's scalp was numb, and their hearts were pounding! &nbsp;</p><p>"Him...do they know each other?!" &nbsp;</p><p>"What's going on? Is there any grudge between Su Changqing and Xiang Yuan? I heard that the young patriarch of the Undying Demon Clan, Xiang Yuan, just entered the world recently. How is this possible?!" &nbsp;</p><p>"What a terrifying aura. How...although Su Changqing just became a Saint not long ago, why does he give people a feeling of having already reached the Saint realm?!" &nbsp;</p><p>"Hiss!!!" &nbsp;</p><p>When they saw the Saintly powers of Su Changqing, various holy lands and cultivators were filled with fear and astonishment.</p><p>Yu Jian was filled with anger, while Su Changqing exuded a chilling intent. The sudden turn of events at this gathering was just too much to handle! The sixth-ranked and fourth-ranked on the Sky List seemed to have an intense blood feud between them! 
Upon seeing Su Changqing's sudden murderous intent, Xiang Yuan's masked eyes furrowed in confusion. "What's going on?!" He could sense the overwhelming terrifying aura emanating from Su Changqing, causing his pupils to constrict. It almost felt like... Su Changqing knew him! 
But today wasn't the first time they had met, so why was Su Changqing suddenly so angry? Xiang Yuan had been instructed by his father to keep a low profile, but he didn't think that the immortal clan would be afraid of these sanctuaries. He had come here just for Su Changqing! This sixth-ranked fellow, who had taken all the limelight, needed to be defeated so he could declare an end to the immortal clan's hidden era! 
As Xiang Yuan was contemplating, Su Changqing's gaze became deep, and the void around him seemed as though it was about to explode, continuously rumbling! At the same time, Su Changqing was also unhesitant as he fabricated his journal. 
"I didn't expect this traitor to appear here!!" 
"In the previous life... this person was friends with Lin Fan!" 
"The human and immortal clans joined forces under the pretense of their strength, but their real objective was to massacre the humans and gain fame!" 
"It's really ridiculous!" 
"I didn't find out about this until twenty years after the war ended in destruction!" 
"And if I'm not mistaken, one of the main instigators of that catastrophe was Xiang Yuan!" 
"In the war of the heavens, this person even betrayed us and colluded with our enemies to save his life!" 
As Su Changqing fabricated his journal, he stared vehemently at Xiang Yuan.  
... 
Meanwhile, Muroi Chouko, who was intially surprised at Su Changqing's sudden murderous intent, saw the update to the journal's copy nearby. "Hmm?" She saw the updated journal and focused intently. Could it be... about Xiang Yuan in the future? 
Filled with countless doubts, Muroi Chouko carefully examined the updated journal's content. "Traitor?" "Friends with Lin Fan?" "The immortal and human clans could work together?" Her beautiful eyes gradually widened in shock. It was no wonder Su Changqing lost his composure and became angry! 
But what did they do in the future?</p><p>"Susan Changqing must have a special reason for having such murderous intent! Especially after reading further, it turns out that Xiangyuan is also one of the sources of the Battle of Destruction, just like Lin Fan! In an instant, Murong Dieyi breathed heavily, suddenly looking towards Xiangyuan with suspicion. "This guy... is in cahoots with that damn Lin Fan!" "They played a big part in the destruction of the demonic sect?!" After reading the diary, her purple eyes glimmered with killing intent. No wonder, no wonder... This way, Su Changqing's anger makes sense! It's all because of this disgusting guy! Damn it! Whether it's Lin Fan or the current undead monster Xiangyuan, they both deserve to die!!! Meanwhile, Xia Qingxuan also looked at Su Changqing with astonishment as he exuded a murderous aura that made the Divine Palace tremble. "How do they know each other!?" "No, wait..." She had felt puzzled, but she remembered that Su Changqing was a reborn individual! So, what could have made Su Changqing so angry from beginning to end?! While she was still wondering, the diary copy slowly opened, revealing new information. "I never thought this traitor would appear here..." Traitor??? Xia Qingxuan was stunned at the first line of the text. "His involvement was due to the Battle of Destruction?!" She looked further down and her gaze fell upon the Xiangyuan who was confronting Su Changqing. And as she read further, "This person actually chose to betray and collude with the enemy for the sake of survival!" Until the end... Xia Qingxuan shook uncontrollably and her breathing became rapid. "This person has absolutely no morals!" "Colluding with the enemy?!" "What else happened later?!" She felt the absurdity of it all, but seeing Su Changqing's murderous intent, she couldn't help but sense the fury within herself as well! In an instant, even Xia Qingxuan had a glimmer of killing intent in her beautiful eyes. "Wait, I..." She felt a difference in her emotional fluctuations, but why? Could it be... that everything was actually real!?" P.S.: The author has released a new book and will definitely work hard to update regularly with guaranteed quality!

            <p>Chapter 1: Ranked Third on the Direct Heavenly Ranking? Has Never Been Defeated?!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment in the Jiuxuan Realm, it has already been enveloped in a thick layer of shock. No one could have imagined that Su Changqing would once again do something earth-shattering.&nbsp;</p><p>"Did Su Changqing kill Xiang Yuan? How could he be so terrifying? He was only ranked sixth, but not long ago he just suppressed the previous top five on the Heavenly Ranking. Now, even the fourth-ranked Xiang Yuan has died at his hands. It's so terrifying!"&nbsp;</p><p>"How could there be such a dreadful person? From beginning to end, I've never heard of Su Changqing being defeated. Is he really just ranked sixth? Clearly, he's in the top three!"&nbsp;</p><p>"The Saint Lord of the Dao is too domineering. Facing the Undead Demon Race that has existed for tens of thousands of years, he doesn't harbor any fear and even threatened to destroy the demon race if there's a next time. Looking at the Jiuxuan Realm, there aren't many forces that dare talk like this!"&nbsp;</p><p>"So, Xiang Yuan originally wanted to kill Su Changqing, but was killed in return? And because of the intervention of Xiang Yuan's protector due to the Undead Demon Race, the demon race lost a supreme powerhouse? Oh my god..."&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, the people in the Jiuxuan Realm were even more shocked and cried out in amazement!&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it's the human race or the demon race and other major forces, they are all shaken!&nbsp;</p><p>They didn't expect such a huge event to occur at the celebration held in the Southern Domain!&nbsp;</p><p>Even just now, the Saint Lord of the Dao and the patriarch of the Undead Demon Race almost engaged in a battle!&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time...&nbsp;</p><p>Countless forces are also filled with anxiety!&nbsp;</p><p>Because the Heavenly Ranking has only just appeared, but such a major event has already occurred!&nbsp;</p><p>Once the Undead Demon Race really goes to war with the Saint Lord of the Dao Zong, other forces will inevitably have friction and clashes between their disciples because of the existence of the Heavenly Ranking!&nbsp;</p><p>It may possibly evolve into a big battle like Su Changqing and Xiang Yuan, and open up one battle after another!&nbsp;</p><p>At that time, the Jiuxuan Realm will break the peace that has lasted for more than 100,000 years and enter an era of chaos!&nbsp;</p><p>However, what is the most shocking is the fact that Su Changqing, after suppressing the top five on the Heavenly Ranking, once again made a move and killed Xiang Yuan of the Undead Demon Race!&nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>However, just as the Jiuxuan Realm was immersed in shock...&nbsp;</p><p>"Boom!!!"&nbsp;</p><p>The sky shook, and there was a sudden change!&nbsp;</p><p>I saw...&nbsp;</p><p>The Heavenly Ranking, originally above the sky, was now shaking violently!&nbsp;</p><p>Around it, there was even a burst of brilliant divine light!&nbsp;</p><p>Under the radiance of the light, the entire world shone brilliantly, appearing extremely sacred!&nbsp;</p><p>Especially with the arrival of the aura of the Heavenly Dao, every cultivator in the Jiuxuan Realm could sense it!&nbsp;</p><p>In the surging clouds, endless thunder crossed the sky!&nbsp;</p><p>Following that, accompanied by a louder and stronger rumble, the name of Xiang Yuan, ranked fourth on the Heavenly Ranking, was erased directly from the Heavenly Ranking!</p><p>Subsequently... The name of the third place was moved down to the fourth place! As for the sixth place, Su Changqing's name was surrounded by a divine light and slowly entered the third place! ãRanking: Dao Yi Sheng Zong - Saint Su Changqing!ã ãRecord: undefeated since entering the world!ã The change in the ranking of the Tianjiao List once again caused a huge stir! Countless Jiu Xuan Celestial people saw Su Changqing go directly from sixth place to third place and were completely boiling! "Su Changqing... he... he's in third place, I said it's not difficult for him to be in the top three with his strength!!!" "It's probably not that simple. Let's not talk about the time before the Tianjiao List came out. Even now, Su Changqing has only made two moves, and he's third place so quickly. I'm afraid his strength is enough to compete for a higher ranking!" "Undefeated since entering the world... my god, how strong is Su Changqing's true strength? Can he compete with the first place and vie for the top spot!?" "Among the younger generation, the Tianjiao List is undoubtedly the best representative now. Although the first and second places will be very strong, I think... Su Changqing really seems to have the strength to compete for first place!" "How did he defeat Xiang Yuan and end up in third place? Could it be that Xiao Xiantai ranks based on the strength it shows?" "It's too scary. Is this the strongest Saint Son of Dao Yi Sheng Zong? I used to think that Su Changqing was not very strong, but now it seems that he is deserving of this position!!!" ... Countless cultivators were shaken to the core after seeing the changes in the Tianjiao List. The results now have exceeded their expectations! Although the record has only a few simple words, it is undoubtedly the best description of Su Changqing's record! Undefeated! Especially with the killing of Xiang Yuan and becoming the third on the Tianjiao List, Su Changqing made all the Jiu Xuan Celestial people feel numb! This kind of existence is too monstrous! The Jiu Xuan Celestial has long been unable to maintain its previous calmness. Countless forces and Tianjiaos who plan to show themselves to the world have begun to take note of Su Changqing's rise in ranking!... While various forces were amazed at Su Changqing's rising ranking, in the Tian Sha Restricted Area, one of the five major restricted areas in Jiu Xuan Celestial, the most mysterious one was undoubtedly a huge soul river, with countless soulless souls wandering about! This is also one of the reasons why the Tian Sha Restricted Area is so terrifying. Every disciple of the Tian Sha Restricted Area likes to extract the souls of their opponents for cultivation. As for the souls of some powerful people, besides being consumed, some have been tamed as companion souls! Countless souls in the soul river are trapped in it for life, never being reincarnated. And now, the originally calm restricted area has been completely shaken! Especially inside the soul river...</p><p>Countless lost souls were no longer swimming as usual, but were all motionless. The cries of astonishment continued to echo!&nbsp;</p><p>"How is this possible!? Su Changqing killed the fourth-ranked Xiang Yuan and is now in third place, pushing Shazi down to fourth?!"&nbsp;</p><p>"My god, does that mean that the Tianjiao List considers Su Changqing to be even stronger than Shazi?!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Is Su Changqing really that strong? What a terrifying guy..."&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone in the Tian Sha Forbidden Zone was shocked, their faces pale and their scalp tingling!&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, deep within the Forbidden Zone, Yu Li was practicing. However, he stopped with a frown when he heard the constant shouting.&nbsp;</p><p>"What is the matter?!" he asked, opening his eyes slowly, his pupils grey.&nbsp;</p><p>But the next second, they returned to normal like an ordinary person's.&nbsp;</p><p>The disciple who came to report the news was extremely anxious, "Shazi, something big has happened. Su Changqing...he...he killed Immortal Yuan from the Undead Clan!!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh? What does that have to do with me?" Yu Li looked surprised. He never expected that Su Changqing, who was ranked sixth, would actually have the strength of the top five. But what did that have to do with him?&nbsp;</p><p>The disciple said again, "No, after Su Changqing killed Xiang Yuan, the ranking of the Tianjiao List changed..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Shazi, you...you dropped from third place to fourth place!"&nbsp;</p><p>Upon hearing this, Yu Li's pupils contracted and he stood up abruptly. The aura of death was raging uncontrollably throughout his body.&nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>P.S.: The author has released a new book and will definitely update regularly with guaranteed quality!

            <p>Chapter 4: The Shock of Princess Dayu and the Witch - Is this the Future?&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Su Youwei felt her world spinning. Was she hallucinating? "It actually opened?!" But before she could recover from her surprise, the diary copy opened automatically! The contents were presented in front of her without reservation!&nbsp;</p><p>"I was reborn...back to ten thousand years ago..." "Darkness...endless darkness..." As she continued to read, Su Youwei's cute face paled and she took several steps back. "What exactly is written on this diary?! Su Changqing was reborn? Ten thousand years later...he was one of the last resistance against the darkness, a terrifying existence!?" "Is the Jiehai really that terrifying? A wave can turn into a world?!"&nbsp;</p><p>When she saw the content, her heart was already in chaos. She didn't even know how the diary came to be, but now she was seeing such astonishing news! Su Changqing revealed the future!? Nine Xuan Heaven of the future will be destroyed by the terrifying Abyss? Not only that, but the entire universe will be bloodied and massacred?!&nbsp;</p><p>After reading this shocking content, Su Youwei couldn't resist her curiosity and continued to read. "The chaos of darkness...all living things in agony...the collapse of the universe..." "The abyss that is filled with blood and darkness invades the universe and all races, the source of darkness in the boundless Jiehai..." "Even the last drop of blood was spilled...but still failed..."&nbsp;</p><p>The more she read, the more shocked she felt, and her face turned paler. Even reading the words on the diary copy made her feel the invisible terror that made her shiver. It was as if she was placed in the boundless darkness described in the content. The diary described the future!? Su Changqing and the mysterious desert, ruthless man, Ye Tian Emperor, and others join forces to resist the chaos of darkness! Even crossing time, spanning the past, present, and future, they still couldn't quell the turmoil?! Such earthshaking events would happen in the future?! The universe will fall?! What is going on beyond the Nine Xuan Heaven? Are there countless planes and even more terrifying existences? What did Su Changqing go through? Is this diary written by the Saint Su himself?&nbsp;</p><p>After recovering from her daze, Su Youwei breathed heavily and looked at the diary copy in front of her with eyes full of shock. "No wonder...no wonder why there is such a monster in the Dao Yi Holy Land. I didn't expect...that he was reborn."</p><p>"The future will experience such terrifying dark turmoil? Even... the extinction of living beings, everything returning to darkness!?" These words shook her to the core, setting off yet another wave of shock and fear. What could be causing this? What has Su Changqing experienced? How did the future end up in destruction? That guy, the last resistance of the gods and all beings, was such a strong presence and yet still lost? &nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Domain of the Silent Sea, located at the very center of the ocean, stood the Holy Maiden Peak of the Demon Sect. Mu Rong Die Yi stared intently at the maid before her. "Didn't you see what's in front of you!?" Her tone urgent, her unparalleled beauty filled with incredulity. Even her fiery body trembled slightly. &nbsp;</p><p>In reply, the maid was at a loss, perplexed by the sight of the stunningly beautiful woman before her. "H-Holy... Holy Maiden... I-I really didn't see anything!" "What's wrong with you!?" She was so desperate that she was about to cry. Was the Holy Maiden losing her mind due to her training??? &nbsp;</p><p>Hearing the maid's answer once again, the purple eyes of Mu Rong Die Yi were filled with shock. "Su Changqing? How did I get a copy of his diary!?" After dismissing the maid, her heart was extremely unsettled. What's going on? The diary suddenly appeared, even entering her mind, and now it can present itself on its own? &nbsp;</p><p>As for Su Changqing, even though Mu Rong Die Yi seldom went out, she heard about him from the elders and disciples of the sect many times. "The holy son of the Daoist One Sect...his diary..." She took a deep breath, completely bewildered. &nbsp;</p><p>And this diary, clearly marked as hers! Is it because of Su Changqing? Or does he not even know he has a diary copy? After taking a deep breath, Mu Rong Die Yi regained her composure and looked coldly at the diary. "I want to see what's in the diary..." Her purple eyes flickered, and she then flipped open the pages. &nbsp;</p><p>Immediately, upon reading the first sentence, she was stunned. Reincarnation?! Su Changqing...has undergone reincarnation!? Even...for Su Changqing, this was thousands of years ago!? From the future to the present? &nbsp;</p><p>Mu Rong Die Yi was completely taken aback by the contents of the diary.</p><p>"Wow, what a shocking opening! 'What's happening?! That guy... reincarnated from the future?!' Her heart raced with shock. Someone being reborn from thousands of years in the future? It's almost unbelievable! She continued reading the diary contents and saw scenes of utter devastation, with all of creation in chaos. The realm's oceans were dominated by a dark overlord! The contents of the diary were enough to make Mu Rong Die Yi scalp prickle, and her beautiful face was visibly moved. 'Is this really about the future?" she wondered. 'Is it true that Nine Xuan Heaven is so small that a single wave from the ocean is of the same size? Can the so-called Realm Sea, just a single wave, actually be an entire world?' Oh my god! At that moment, Mu Rong Die Yi's breath became labored, and she read on with shock and trembling. 'Dark upheaval? The entire universe is collapsing into infinite darkness?! Under this great war, all life... ends up in silence?' She read further - 'Su Changqing took part in the dark upheaval and even though he and other strong people from various races tried their best, they could not quell the upheaval. Eventually, everyone died!' After reading the latest contents of the diary, she was completely shocked. Did Su Changqing write about what would happen in the future? And this guy's future had gone through such a horrific dark upheaval? How could this have happened? Mu Rong Die Yi could not calm her heart, which was filled with shock and disbelief. Was this really true? Did Su Changqing experience the dark upheaval and then be reborn? Her mind was filled with questions, and doubts and she just couldn't believe it. However, if this was all fake, then why did she feel that almost suffocating horror and that sadness which belonged to Su Changqing through the diary's contents? Was the future really going to be like this?" ... followed by some HTML code inviting readers to continue reading the story.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1: First wave of rewards issued, Supreme Bone of Primordial Chaos!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Murong Dieyi's breath quickened as she stared fixedly at the content on the diary excerpt.&nbsp;</p><p>"The woman I care about most? Will I have a romantic relationship with Su Changqing in the future!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"This...?"&nbsp;</p><p>"What did he call me? A little girl!?"&nbsp;</p><p>She felt like she was struck by a lightning bolt and stood motionless. What did this mean? She would have some kind of connection with Su Changqing in the future!? &nbsp;</p><p>But she was so cold and ruthless, how could she have feelings for anyone else!? &nbsp;</p><p>And, did Su Changqing not care about this at all? People called her a witch, but this guy...&nbsp;</p><p>For some reason, Murong Dieyi felt her face burning hot, completely unaware of what would happen with Su Changqing in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>"I will have feelings with Su Changqing in the future!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"What happened between us?!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Can he make me fall for him? Is he really that amazing!?"&nbsp;</p><p>She stared at the content on the diary excerpt, with countless thoughts flashing through her mind. Even if she believed in the credibility of Su Changqing's diary, she did not believe that she would like someone else! &nbsp;</p><p>Does this guy really have such great ability??&nbsp;</p><p>After a while...&nbsp;</p><p>Murong Dieyi pulled herself together and, for the first time, a cold, emotionless face showed a smile. &nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing... If I have a chance, I want to see what kind of connection we have!" &nbsp;</p><p>She took a deep breath and didn't dwell on this issue any further. &nbsp;</p><p>As for Su Changqing, she was sure she would have the opportunity to meet him. &nbsp;</p><p>Then, she would see if those things that he mentioned in his diary would happen!&nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>In the shock of the diary holders,&nbsp;</p><p>Dao Yi Holy Sect, Son of the Holy Peak.&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing now sits leisurely with his legs crossed, waiting leisurely. &nbsp;</p><p>"I've finished the first diary entry. They should have read it by now and maybe even tried it out."&nbsp;</p><p>"I wonder how much the trust level will increase?"&nbsp;</p><p>He muttered softly, his face filled with a smile. &nbsp;</p><p>For the first diary entry, he was naturally confident!&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did he point out the problems with Ling Qianshu and Su Yuwei, but he also provided a solution!&nbsp;</p><p>As long as they try, the two will definitely believe what he said!&nbsp;</p><p>After all, for the development of the story, he was well-versed and spoiling the future was just a small problem.&nbsp;</p><p>And it was at this moment...&nbsp;</p><p>[Ding!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Trust level has significantly increased for three diary holders!]&nbsp;</p><p>[The current trust value of diary holders is as follows...]&nbsp;</p><p>[Dao Yi Holy Sect Holy Maiden Ling Qianshu - Trust level:!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Great Feather Dynasty Princess Su Yuwei - Trust level: !]</p><p>As the system's voice echoed in his mind, Su Changqing's eyes lit up at the sight of the trust values of the three diary holders. "I can't believe it," he thought to himself. The effect of the first diary entry was remarkable, as both Ling Qianxue and Su Yuwei's trust values had skyrocketed to one hundred. Even the cold and suspicious Muroi Dieyi now had a trust value of ten.&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing was not only surprised, but also delighted. "If this is the case, then the diaries I fabricate later will surely gain even more trust values," he said to himself. In the end, it seemed that he would have to rely on his own abilities to make the female leads bend to his will. Otherwise, if he followed the original plot line, the story would be unbearable and even eye-roll inducing.&nbsp;</p><p>Before he could delve further into his thoughts, a system notification interrupted him. "Ding! Host's first diary has been completed, and you've received a new player bonus pack! Congratulations on advancing from divine king to sage realm, and on obtaining a Soul-Nourishing Pill, a Supreme Primordial Bone, a High-Quality Spiritual Stone, a fragment of Ultimate Emperor's Weapon - Void Mirror, and a fragment of character - Emperor of the Underworld! Congratulations on obtaining the True Dragon Spell. Due to the strength of the spell, the host must step by step in mastering it. Note: If the host doesn't need these rewards, they can be stored in the storage space! Do you want to claim these rewards now?"&nbsp;</p><p>As the succession of system voices continuously echoed in his mind, Su Changqing's body began to tremble, and his breath quickened. "The sage realm," he intoned in amazement. He had not expected that the very first reward would allow him to break through almost three levels in the realm system, granting him direct access to the sage realm!&nbsp;</p><p>In this world, the realm system was divided into nine stages: physical body, foundation building, spirit sea, ten thousand laws, divine king, true saint, immortal stage, supreme ruler, and quasi emperor. But that was not all, there were also incredible items such as the Supreme Primordial Bone and the Ultimate Emperor's Weapon - Void Mirror fragment. Once all the fragments of the Void Mirror were collected, they could unlock the god-tier artifact capable of traversing through time and space, imprisoning and shattering anything in its path!&nbsp;</p><p>There was also the fragment of the character - Emperor of the Underworld. However, the process of obtaining these rewards seemed to be endless.</p><p>"ç©ç¢ç...... Black Emperor's Broken Virtue?"
"Six fragments?"
Especially after hearing the last True Dragon Spell, Su Changqing couldn't help but shudder with excitement.
"The True Dragon Spell of the Ten Evils... My goodness..."
His heart was racing. This was the complete version of the True Dragon Spell, not just a few scattered moves!
The reward this time was too, too, too rich!!!
With these rewards, as a villain, it would be easy to grow and become the best in this world!
Just thinking about it made Su Changqing's mouth dry and his eyes more excited!
"Wonderful!"
Without hesitation, he immediately said, "Claim it now!!!"
As he spoke, the rewards began to materialize!
At that moment, Su Changqing's mind was flooded with a lot of information!
"The cultivation method of the True Dragon Spell..."
His eyes lit up, and he eagerly received the rewards, suppressing his inner excitement!
In addition, the void in front of him began to tear apart, revealing a bone that was three inches long and emitted brilliant golden light and endless Dao Rhymes!
The Primordial Supreme Bone!!!
At this moment, in Su Changqing's eyes...
The Primordial Supreme Bone drifted slowly to his chest, then entered it!
In an instant, Su Changqing's face turned pale, and his body trembled uncontrollably!
"Hiss!!"
He took a deep breath, wearing a mask of pain!
This power was too domineering!
It was truly the Primordial Supreme Bone!
It was not something that could be compared to other supreme bones!
At the same time, Su Changqing was surrounded by sparkling golden light, and the void around him trembled as if it was about to collapse!
"Boom!"
Inside his body, a terrifying roar erupted continuously!

            <p>ç¬¬ä¸ç« ï¼What has his weathered gaze experienced?
[Ding!]
[System is detecting... Detection complete...]
[Name: Chu Ming!]
[Identity: Disciple of Daoist Saint Sect (Host follower)!]
[Encounter: His father was seriously injured by enemies seeking revenge, and if nothing unexpected happens, he will die in half a month. His mother is heartbroken and follows his father, causing Chu Ming to become blackened!]
[Note: This person has good aptitude, the host can invest in him!]
Listening to the voice in his mind, Su Changqing was stunned for a moment before blinking.
"Investing?"
He remembered that the system also had an investment function, and after success, he could get critical strike returns!
In this way, wouldn't he be able to get a reliable assistant?
After all, in the original text, the ability of the small villain in front of him was among the best of many followers, but was written too brainlessly and became a stepping stone for the male lead.
Why not invest in him?
Seeing that Su Changqing hadn't spoken yet,
Chu Ming was anxious, but he still tried to cover it up and forced a smile, "If it's not possible, Your Holiness...I'll take my leave!"
"Here are ten Revitalizing Pills, take them." 
Su Changqing waved his big hand, and a delicate jade bottle floated out.
At the sound of this, Chu Ming, who was about to turn around, was shocked and dumbfounded as he looked at the bottle in front of him, then looked at Su Changqing indifferently.
"This... Your Holiness..." 
His heart was pounding, and his mind was blank.
What's going on here?
Your Holiness actually gave him elixirs, ten precious Revitalizing Pills at that!!!
If it were an ordinary outer disciple, it would probably take several years to save enough spirit stones to exchange for one!
Even for an inner disciple, it's not easy to get!
This pill is not only of great help to the cultivation process but also has the incredible life-saving power for the injured!
Seeing this, Su Changqing said calmly, "You may go with peace of mind."
After speaking, he turned and said no more.
Watching his back, Chu Ming's breath became short, and his body shook with excitement!
"Chu Ming...Thank you, Your Holiness!!!"
He took the pill, his eyes flickering with tears, and immediately knelt down heavily!
Father can be saved!
He didn't say much, knowing that his strength was too weak right now.
But from now on, he will definitely swear to follow Su Changqing to the death!
Upon standing up, Chu Ming didn't say much more and hurriedly left.
However, at this moment,
[Ding!]
[Congratulations to the host for successful investment and obtaining Chu Ming's absolute loyalty!]
[Congratulations to the host...]</p><p>"Get critical strike reimbursement - Purple Gold Refining Marrow Pill!" 
(Note: Purple Gold Refining Marrow Pill has a strong consolidation effect. For each level, taking it has great benefits and remarkable effects.) 
The system's voice sounded again. 
Purple Gold Refining Marrow Pill? 
Su Changqing smiled slightly, then swallowed the pill in front of him, which was emitting an unusual glow like candy. 
"Um..." 
As soon as the pill entered his mouth, he could feel it turn into a warm current flowing down his throat. 
Then, his body trembled slightly. 
The spiritual energy in his body surged like a landslide and a tsunami! 
After a moment... 
Su Changqing's breath was stronger than before, causing him to sigh. 
"Just after a short time, has the foundation of the Holy Realm been completely consolidated?" 
He was surprised but also satisfied with the results. 
If he could invest more, undoubtedly, this would be a way to improve his strength. 
Not only that, he could even get powerful followers! 
What's not to love about this investment? 
Nearby, Ling Qianxue saw the entire process and was full of doubt. 
"Su Changqing... What are you doing?" 
A small disciple, worthy of Su Changqing's personal attention and even giving pills for free?! 
She thought she had seen it wrong. 
Could it be that his temperament had changed so much after recovering his memory? 
At the thought of this, she couldn't help but feel heartbroken. 
But after the disciple left, Ling Qianxue felt even stronger energy from Su Changqing's back! 
"Hiss..." 
She took a deep breath and was shaken. 
Was his cultivation always improving even when he wasn't training? 
How strong! 
This made her more determined to not let Su Changqing fall into darkness! 
Before Ling Qianxue could decide what to do... 
"Go back, go back and take a look at your father at home..." 
"The future... everything will be destroyed. In my past life, maybe I didn't care, but now, it doesn't matter." 
"If he doesn't go back this time, perhaps we won't be able to see each other again this lifetime. Don't leave any regrets!" 
"If he can grow, I hope he can resist the dark turmoil in the future... Ha, I'm thinking too much. The future's dark chaos is terrifying and impossible to resist." 
"As for me... there are people I want to see too..." 
The diary appeared, revealing the update content. 
Ling Qianxue looked at the content and felt heartbroken. 
"So that's how it is..." 
She sighed and knew that Su Changqing's temperament had changed drastically. 
And the culprit for all of this was the dark turmoil in the future.</p><p>"Oh no!" 
Aside from feeling sorry, she didn't know what she could do. 
She felt a hint of sadness and her nose tingled. 
After sorting her thoughts, Ling Qianxue gathered her courage and walked over. 
"Phew..." 
She was nervous and her heart was beating fast. 
Hearing footsteps behind her, Su Changqing slowly turned around and saw the ethereal Ling Qianxue, looking like a fairy in her long green dress. 
"Um... Qianxue junior sister?" 
He saw the unmistakable aura of a saint in her cold temperament, which was described clearly in the original text. 
Noticing Su Changqing's gaze, Ling Qianxue trembled slightly and her breathing became hurried. 
"What Su Changqing said... it must be true, he really has been reborn!!" 
She noticed the boundless exhaustion in Su Changqing's deep eyes and became even more convinced. 
But what should she say? 
She thought she had mustered enough courage, but standing in front of Su Changqing, Ling Qianxue didn't know how to start. 
They just stared at each other without a word. 
Finally, Ling Qianxue took a deep breath and said awkwardly, "Senior Brother..." 
This was the first time she addressed Su Changqing as such! 
In fact, he was indeed her senior brother! 
But in the past, she and the Holy Son Su Changqing were not familiar with each other. 
She always wanted to compete with him and prove herself. 
Now looking back, Su Changqing always let her win. 
And after learning about what would happen in the future, Ling Qianxue looked at Su Changqing... 
She blushed a bit and became even more awkward!

            <ns0:content type="html">
            <p>The Collapse War a hundred years later was all because of the male lead! At this moment, Su Changqing was pondering on what to reveal next at the peak of the Saint Son in the Dao One Holy Sect. "By this time, the male lead in the book should be preparing to enter the Dao One Holy Sect," he muttered, then his eyes brightened. He had an idea!&nbsp;</p><p>As the original plot went, a shocking and devastating war would occur a hundred years later! The reason for this was completely created by the author to make the male lead look cool! If he revealed it earlier, wouldn't the female leads believe in themselves even more? Thinking of this, Su Changqing didn't hesitate and began to supplement the diary.&nbsp;</p><p>"If I remember correctly, a hundred years later, a unprecedented war will erupt in the Jiuxuan Celestial Realm - the Collapse War. In that war, the Dao One Holy Sect, the Great Feather Empire, the Hidden Sea Demon Sect, and many other sanctuaries will be involved...and a huge battle will break out!"&nbsp;</p><p>Originally, it was just an ordinary emperor's tool, but unexpectedly, it became the fuse of the Collapse War! It was this war that involved too many forces and shattered almost the entire Jiuxuan Celestial Realm! Meanwhile, Ling Qianxue, who had been paying attention to the updates of the diary, was in the Saint Maiden Peak.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Collapse War? Even the Jiuxuan Celestial Realm was almost shattered?" She had been absent-mindedly thinking about how to get along with Su Changqing, but seeing the diary being updated again, her expression changed. One hundred years later...there would be such a terrifying war? What was the reason? In an instant, Ling Qianxue's expression became serious and her breathing became rapid. "Could it be that the Dark Turmoil will come to the Jiuxuan Celestial Realm in a hundred years because of this war?" She took a deep breath and trembled slightly. If that was the case, wouldn't it be too soon? Did the turmoil last for ten thousand years because of a single emperor's tool?&nbsp;</p><p>She was also shocked by the fact that the description of the emperor's tool by Su Changqing was so ordinary. However, after pondering for a moment, Ling Qianxue thought that everything that happened to her senior brother after being reborn from ten thousand years ago was now considered ordinary. With a sense of shock in her heart, she watched the updated content of the diary with great seriousness.&nbsp;</p><p>"I really didn't expect that it was just because of an emperor's tool that everything happened..." "That day, the emperor's tool appeared, triggering three days and three nights of strange phenomena in the world, causing the entire Jiuxuan Celestial Realm to tremble! The major sanctuaries and the heavenly empire successively set out to rush to the Eastern region, but they did not know... that this caused the whole Jiuxuan Celestial Realm to fall into an unprecedented disaster, almost breaking it, and leaving behind an irreparable shocking crack..."</p><p>"Feng!" 
"And this, is the cause of the looming dark turmoil in the future!" 
"Exactly!!!" 
As Ling Qianxue read this, her breathing turned rapid, and her chest heaved. 
"How could this be!?" 
She was shaken and urgently wanted to know more about what happened next! 
What kind of terrifying war could have caused such a severe consequence?! 
"In this war, Dao Yi Sheng Zong suffered heavy losses, with half of its disciples dying in the war. External elders, internal elders and even the Grand Elder, all were killed. Even the Saint Lord was injured in the battle and his later death was ultimately due to those injuries!" 
"The Great Yu Dynasty was also destroyed by this war. If it weren't for the Emperor burning his soul and using the imperial treasure to protect the dynasty, this Nine Xuan Heaven's top dynasty might have ceased to exist..." 
"This War of Destruction swept across the entire Nine Xuan Heaven, and too many innocent people were affected. The sky was red with blood that day, and countless souls were unable to pass on, their mournful cries filling the air!" 
"That war lasted for nearly half a month and plunged the entire Nine Xuan Heaven into darkness until it was on the verge of collapse!" 
"The most vivid and brutal memory... was still the Mystic Sea Demon Sect, where... where Die Yi resided!" 
"In that war, all the inner and outer elders, as well as the sect's disciples, died without exception!" 
"The Demon Lords staked their lives, summoning the ancient demons with their own blood, but they were unable to turn the tide and eventually disappeared without a trace!" 
"After that, the entire Demon Sect only had Die Yi left..." 
"Through this war, the Nine Xuan Heaven was collapsing, and the major powers were struggling to survive. Despite the cessation of hostilities for thousands of years, they were still unable to make up for it..." 
"At the time, I didn't know the reason behind it, but now... I understand!" 
"The fuse that caused this war was also one of the important factors, if I remember correctly, it was a person named Lin Fan, right?" 
"At this moment, he should be preparing to join the Dao Yi Sheng Zong." 
"At the end of the war, the creatures of Nine Xuan Heaven suffered greatly, and the laws were also affected, while the imperial treasures were gained to a large extent." 
"It was also his identity that caused the relationship between Dao Yi Sheng Zong and the Demon Sect to become irreconcilable, and between me and Die Yi... so it came to an end..." 
"Do I... want to intercept him?" 
"Forget it, I'm really tired. Lin Fan? The impact he caused at the end of the day was not small for Nine Xuan Heaven, but compared to the future, it was nothing!" 
"I've been reborn and have learned everything about the future..." 
"This life, I just want to rest, just want to make up for the regrets!" 
...
Looking at the future revealed in the diary, Die Yi of the Demon Sect was shocked.</p><p>"After a century... the Battle of Collapse!?" She breathed heavily, trying to imagine the sheer horror of such a war. At the same time, she felt excited. Finally, she had glimpsed some of the things that would happen in the future! But just as Murong Dieyi was about to see the result of this great battle, she suddenly heard, "That battle planted the seeds for the Dark Turmoil?" She trembled, her face changing with shock. How could this be? Even the ancient emperor's tools, coveted by countless people, shouldn't have caused such a serious outcome! But when Murong Dieyi looked down, she realized the gravity of the situation. "Dao One Holy Clan suffered heavy losses, losing half of their strength in the Battle of Collapse!?" "The Great Feather Dynasty almost collapsed as well, and it was only saved by the Emperor's tool?" She breathed even more heavily, her heart in unprecedented turmoil. Blood stained the sky, and countless souls were unjustly killed... Even the entire Nine Xuan Heaven was shattered, leaving behind an irreparable and shocking fissure! Oh my God!!! At that moment, Murong Dieyi's expression changed, and she looked at the diary copy before her with great solemnity. "This..." She shuddered, her mouth dry. And as she read the content about the Demon Sect in the Battle of Collapse, her face changed even more!!! ...&nbsp;</p><p>P.S.: The author has released a new book and promises to update it diligently with guaranteed quality.

            <p>Chapter One: The Arrival of a New Female Lead, Another Scam Begins!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, the people from Beiming Holy Land in Zhongzhou jumped off the Xuan Bird one after another.&nbsp;</p><p>Among them, an old man with a smiling face bowed to the various holy places around him and said, "Beiming Holy Land came uninvited to this event in the Southern Region. Please forgive us."&nbsp;</p><p>He spoke cheerfully and looked quite amiable.&nbsp;</p><p>Beside the old man, a young man with short hair that appeared rather sunny gazed at the people in the various holy places around him, as if he was looking for something.&nbsp;</p><p>And by their side, a fair-skinned and sweet-looking girl remained calm.&nbsp;</p><p>She was the daughter of the Beiming Holy Land's Lord and also the current Saintess of Beiming Holy Land.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as she was recognized, there was a commotion in the audience.&nbsp;</p><p>As the fifth-ranked person on the Heavenly Pride List, Xia Qingxuan appeared calm, but she was a bit curious.&nbsp;</p><p>"Suzhou Changqing...," she murmured, wondering if this disciple of Daoist One Sect was present.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, she had heard that he would represent Daoist One Sect to participate in this event.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally, the Southern Region's centennial event had nothing to do with Zhongzhou, but Xia Yulin had reached adulthood and wanted to experience the world. This was a perfect opportunity for him.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially when this little guy heard the news that Suzhou Changqing had single-handedly defeated the previous top five Heavenly Pride List, he had been shouting that he wanted to challenge this disciple of Daoist One Sect and walk the path of invincibility to be included on the Heavenly Pride List!&nbsp;</p><p>In the midst of the commotion, Suzhou Changqing kept his eyes fixed on Xia Qingxuan, never wavering.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing this, Mu Rong Dieyi looked at Xia Qingxuan, then at Suzhou Changqing.&nbsp;</p><p>"Hmph!"&nbsp;</p><p>She was a little unhappy and snorted.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn't even look at me when I was sitting right beside him. Why is he looking at her?&nbsp;</p><p>Just because she's ranked fifth on the Heavenly Pride List?&nbsp;</p><p>Even if he wasn't ranked on the list, he was a warlock, and he wasn't bad-looking in the face or figure department!&nbsp;</p><p>Little did she know, the reason why Suzhou Changqing was a bit starry-eyed was because he received a message from the system in his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>[Ding! Congratulations to the host for earning the maximum trust points from two diary holders, which allows for the addition of a new diary copy!&nbsp;</p><p>[Newly added person: Xia Qingxuan, Beiming Holy Land's Saintess!&nbsp;</p><p>[Current diary holders: 1. Ling Qianxue, Daoist One Sect's Holy Maiden! 2. Mu Rong Dieyi, Sea Witch! 3. Su Yuwei, Princess Dayu! 4. Xia Qingxuan!&nbsp;</p><p>[Note: To add a new character next time, four diary holders must exceed the maximum trust value to reach a state of extreme trust!]&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Suzhou Changqing heard the system's prompt in his mind and his eyes brightened.&nbsp;</p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk...this is interesting!"&nbsp;</p><p>"The next time I add a diary copy..."</p><p>"The holders need to gain the utmost trust from all four of them. Looks like I have to work even harder to convince them...â he muttered to himself, a smile playing on his lips. However, reaching the next target of adding another character might pose a challenge. After all, he had yet to encounter the little girl from the Great Feather Divine Dynasty, and now with Xia Qingxuan, the newly unlocked female lead from the original text, it might not be so easy to completely dominate the game. Nevertheless, time is on his side... Meanwhile, the various holy sites were not opposed to the arrival of the North Ming Divine Dynasty. In fact, they were quite intrigued. Suddenly, Xia Qingxuan felt a strange connection and her body trembled. "Huh?!" she exclaimed, looking around. What's going on? Just as she was wondering, a golden light sphere that no one could detect entered her forehead at a terrifying speed! "Boom!!!" Without even realizing what had happened, a loud rumbling noise sounded in her mind! Then, before her, a shining, ancient diary slowly emerged, adorned with several illuminated words. ãXia Qingxuan Diary Copy!ã Upon seeing this scene, Xia Qingxuan was finally no longer calm, completely shocked! "What's...?" She took a few steps back, almost crying out in astonishment. In an instant, Xia Yilin next to her asked, "Sis, what's wrong??" The other disciples of the North Ming Divine Dynasty also looked over. What's wrong with the Saintess? Did she experience a hallucination from practicing too hard recently??? After hearing everyone's exact responses, Xia Qingxuan's heart was even more turbulent, and she looked at the diary before her, amazed. "My diary copy..." She suppressed her inner shock and focused her thoughts on the emerging information in her mind, causing the diary to open. However, as she read the first line of words, Xia Qingxuan's body trembled. "This..." She gasped, the shock in her eyes becoming more intense! With endless curiosity, she continued to peruse this diary that was labeled as Su Changqing's, yet belonged only to her. The further she read, the more intense the shock in Xia Qingxuan's eyes became, and her body trembled uncontrollably. "Darkness stirred..."</p><p>âChaos? All the creatures of the heavens are suffering...â 
âDesolation, heartless people, Wu Shi...â 
âSu Changqing, he... he...â 
âHuh?! The saintess of Dao Yi Holy Sect, the princess of Great Yu Dynasty, they are all his partners? Even... the witch of Demon Sect had a romantic relationship with him?!â 
She looked at the contents of the diary, feeling a creeping sensation on her scalp! 
What's all this about?! 
Continuing to read... 
The shock in Xia Qingxuan's heart was overwhelming and her mind went blank! 
"The Battle of Annihilation? " 
"Three hundred years later it will be a true chaotic time, causing a war of the heavens? " 
"This... this..." 
"So many things will happen in the future? " 
After finishing reading the diary, she looked bewildered! 
She never expected that Su Changqing, the saint of Dao Yi Holy Sect, was actually a reborn person!!! 
He had come back to the present from the future! 
... 
Meanwhile, 
In the area where Dao Yi Holy Sect was located, Su Changqing looked at Xia Qingxuan's changing expression, knowing that she had obtained a copy of the diary and now he had to fabricate the contents! 
[Qingxuan, why is she here?] 
[According to reason, she did not attend this celebration in her previous life...] 
[After so many years, she is still so lonely.] 
[Originally we were supposed to meet in the Battle of Annihilation a hundred years later, but unexpectedly we met now. It seems... that my rebirth has had some impact on this world.] 
[But does she know that in the previous life, I lost her and owe her so much?] 
[In this life, I remember her, but she doesn't remember me...] 
...

            <p>In Chapter 1, Su Changqing confidently declares that the top five on the leaderboard won't be enough for him to fight. Half an hour later, the leaderboard for the top ten is announced on the Tianjiao List. The first five include Mingzi Jiuyou from Xuanming Holy Land, the Young Master Wang Teng from Hidden Dragon Temple, and Shenzhi Sima Chen from Tianyan Divine Palace. Su Changqing is seated in a window within the Sacred Son Peak, looking pleased with what he sees. Although he isn't too concerned with ranking sixth, he is more focused on fabricating a diary entry. He is also aware of people who genuinely possess real skills and abilities, despite being unrecognized on the leaderboard. Among them is Wang Ye, a Taoist from the Western Region, who has been in hiding for thousands of years with a pure ancient dragon bloodline, and Xia Qingxuan from the Northern Ming Sacred Land, who carries the aura of the Underworld Race. These and three other individuals are said to be more powerful than the current top five. Meanwhile, in the Demon Sect, Murong Dieyi has fully absorbed the magic element fruit and is now even more powerful than before. She is grateful to Su Changqing for helping her acquire the fruit and reflects on how it has helped her ascend into godhood. She smiles and looks forward to the upcoming Nine Xuan Ceremony, held only once every hundred years.</p><p>The Gathering is Coming! 
All the prestigious clans and sects of the entire Jiuxuan Heaven and the Holy Land will come together for this grand event. This year, it's Dao One Holy Sect's turn to host the event. I'll be attending too, and it's the perfect opportunity to meet Su Changqing. This man... is someone I'll have a romantic relationship with in the future! But upon seeing the real-life Heavenly Pride List, Murong Dieyi browsed through it and noticed that Su Changqing was only in sixth place. "Su Changqing is only sixth??" She furrowed her eyebrows, feeling puzzled. What's going on here? And her name wasn't on the list at all. She heard the prompt after the list was released and her eyes sparkled with desire: "Getting the favor of the heavens?" Her battle intent was immediately ignited! But at this moment, the diary replica appeared. "Those five who came before me are just a bunch of hollow men, not worthy opponents compared to me..." Murong Dieyi squinted at the content. So that's how it is... No wonder! But when she saw that Su Changqing only mentioned unfamiliar names after the first five, her curiosity was piqued. "The five mentioned in the diary will take the top five spots on the Heavenly Pride List?" "Is that so?" She couldn't help but feel puzzled because she had rarely heard any of their names and they didn't leave an impression on her. Yet Su Changqing said that the diary's top five would replace the current list? And these people will soon reveal their power to the world? But come to think of it... Being on the list and receiving the favor of the heavens would greatly enhance their cultivation. Moreover, the Heavenly Prides who make it to the top five will receive favor... wouldn't they make tremendous progress? Finally... Murong Dieyi saw Su Changqing's praise in the diary and blinked. "Hehe..." She smiled on her cold and beautiful face, unable to help herself. Now she was even more eager to meet this son of Dao One Holy Sect! At the same time, on the Saintess Peak, Ling Qianshuang was seriously reading the latest diary contents. "These people...are the true Heavenly Prides?" She was puzzled by the names Su Changqing mentioned. Among them, the Dragon Emperor's son, Long San, was the only one she knew. However, this person didn't have many outstanding achievements, yet had the strength to compete for the top five of the list? As for her senior brother...</p><p>As she read through the diary, Ling Qianxue's heart sank. She had always looked up to her senior brother, Su Changqing, but it seemed that he was destined to be with someone else. The mention of a witch from the demonic sect stirred a hint of jealousy and animosity in her heart. She had previously struggled with the idea of sharing her senior brother's love with another, but now the thought of being inferior to someone else made her clench her fists in determination. She vowed to work harder in her cultivation and surpass the witch on the list, so that she could rightfully stand by her senior brother's side.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the rest of the Nine Realms were in an uproar over the release of the "Heavenly Prodigy List", a ranking of the most talented individuals in the world. Many coveted a spot on the list and the chance to challenge those ranked higher, as victory could potentially lead to favor from the heavens and a clear path towards enlightenment. Countless individuals flocked towards this opportunity, including previously reclusive prodigies who couldn't resist the temptation of a challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>On a separate note, the author of this story has released a new book and promises a high-quality, frequent update schedule. They humbly request the support of readers in the form of likes, comments, and Flower Voting to help them grow their audience.</p>

            <p>Chapter 4: The Deception Is In Place, and Each Female Lead's Killing Intent Explodes!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, as Yuan turned back to his senses, his eyes turned cold.&nbsp;</p><p>"Hmm?" Just as he was preparing to make a move, he suddenly froze.&nbsp;</p><p>Because... he could clearly sense that two powerful killing intents had suddenly appeared on the scene!&nbsp;</p><p>He looked around uncertainly, taking a deep breath in amazement. "What is this?" he wondered. What was going on?!&nbsp;</p><p>If he hadn't recognized it wrong, the woman in the red dress sitting next to Su Changqing was the witch of the Demon Sect! The other woman, who was looking at him with a cold expression, was the saintess of the North Ming Sect!&nbsp;</p><p>What did this mean?! He came for Su Changqing, but why did these two women have killing intent towards him?! They didn't even have any intersections with each other, much less provoke anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Could it be... because of Su Changqing??? Did this guy have such a heavy weight that even two genius women had opinions of him?!&nbsp;</p><p>After pondering for a while, Yuan snorted coldly in his heart and didn't care about it anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>"Today, itâs the second time since I entered the world. Su Changqing..." he muttered to himself, laughing coldly.&nbsp;</p><p>He came uninvited this time just to declare his entry into the world with Su Changqing's head! At the same time, it was also to proclaim that the Undead Yao Clan would return to the world and participate in the big world war!&nbsp;</p><p>As for his old man... Yuan felt that he had lived too long, and he was afraid of too many things.&nbsp;</p><p>"Although the Undead Yao Clan has not participated in any disputes for many years, our foundation is still there. Can the Dao One Sect still go to war with the Yao Clan if I fight Su Changqing head-on?" he laughed coldly in his heart and took a step forward at this moment.&nbsp;</p><p>"Boom!" The void shattered, and the strong Saint Qi surged across the field!&nbsp;</p><p>Amidst the deafening roar, countless eyes saw that Yuan was emitting an astonishing decay aura, and the Yao Qi was soaring! The boundless Yao Qi enveloped the sky and the earth, causing everyone on the scene to have a change in their expression.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuan stood on the void with strange eyes, like the lord of all demons, and said, "Su Changqing... fight me!"&nbsp;</p><p>He slowly raised his hand and pointed at Su Changqing, whose killing intent had already overflowed at this moment.&nbsp;</p><p>"Yuan... the traitor of Jiu Xuan realm!"&nbsp;</p><p>"In the War of Collapse, you conspired with Lin Fan and slaughtered the people of various great sects. Such sins are unforgivable, and you can be killed by anyone!"&nbsp;</p><p>"During the middle stage of the War of the Heavens, you betrayed Dao One Sect and North Ming Sect's battle plan, causing the invasion of outside forces to be easy and uncontrollable..."</p><p>"The breach of the defensive lines set up by the two holy places is a crime that deserves death! And when the Nine Profound Heavens was on the brink of collapse, you chose to betray and allied with the enemies from outside the heavens, leading to the downfall of the already failing Nine Profound Heavens. This is a crime that deserves death! In every future action you take, you deserve to die a thousand times... and it still wouldn't be enough!! Last lifetime, I wasn't able to kill you with my own hands. But this lifetime... today is your last day!"&nbsp;</p><p>His eyes could no longer restrain the killing intent, and it burst out completely!&nbsp;</p><p>In just an instant, a murderous aura that seemed to destroy the heavens and earth poured out!&nbsp;</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Su Changqing's figure flashed, and with a burst of sonic booms, he headed straight for Xiangyuan in the void!&nbsp;</p><p>"Rebel of the Nine Profound Heavens!"&nbsp;</p><p>As he approached, he suddenly slapped his palm!&nbsp;</p><p>The void exploded and the breath was violent!&nbsp;</p><p>A single palm made countless people on-site tremble with fear and their minds blank!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Su Changqing was like an enraged killing god!&nbsp;</p><p>The overwhelming murderous intent poured out of him, causing the sky above him to pale in comparison!&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing Su Changqing, who had appeared in front of him in the blink of an eye with a destructive force, Xiangyuan's pupils suddenly shrank, and he dared not collide head-on with him!&nbsp;</p><p>"Rebel? Me?" He frowned at Su Changqing's words, not understanding what he meant.&nbsp;</p><p>But without waiting for Xiangyuan to think more, Su Changqing's anger burned, and his murderous aura seemed to have become substantial!&nbsp;</p><p>"Your body is burdened with too many unjust souls of the Nine Profound Heavens," he said coldly, causing the temperature around them to drop suddenly.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn't give the other party a chance to catch their breath. He instantly appeared behind Xiangyuan and punched with a fist carrying a destructive aura!&nbsp;</p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang..."&nbsp;</p><p>Under the terrifying speed, the earth and the sky trembled, causing the entire divine palace to shake!&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing Su Changqing disappear in front of him, Xiangyuan's back became cold, and he felt a strong sense of crisis rising in his heart!&nbsp;</p><p>"Ten Thousand Demon Seal!" &nbsp;</p><p>He was now focusing, no longer as complacent as before. His hands quickly formed a seal, and he turned around and clapped his palms!&nbsp;</p><p>Instantly, a strong dark light burst forth!&nbsp;</p><p>The virtual images of huge demonic beasts kept appearing behind him, emitting ear-splitting roars!&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone on the scene was in pain and covered their ears.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon...&nbsp;</p><p>The two finally collided for the first time!&nbsp;</p><p>"Boom!"&nbsp;</p><p>The scene shook violently, and the violent aura spread in all directions!&nbsp;</p><p>Above the sky, there was an incessant boom!&nbsp;</p><p>Even the barriers set up by the supreme beings tens of thousands of years ago in the divine palace were shaking!&nbsp;</p><p>Cracks continued to spread on the ground below.</p><p>As the crowd watched in shock, the battle raged on between the fourth and sixth on the Heavenly Prodigy List. Both Su Changqing and Xiang Yuan were undoubtedly representatives of the younger generation of Nine Xuan Heaven. Everyone wondered who would emerge as the victor. Despite their best efforts, nobody could approach the scene due to the overwhelming sense of danger that permeated the area, and they could only watch as the two fought again.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Murong Dieyi was reading a diary entry and feeling absolutely shocked. She couldn't believe what Xiang Yuan had done in the future and was filled with anger. She felt that a person like him deserved to die. No wonder Su Changqing had lost his composure upon hearing his name. If it were her, she would've wanted to kill him too.&nbsp;</p><p>Murong Dieyi looked at Su Changqing's back and realized that he wasn't exactly as the diary had described him. He, too, clearly had a strong desire to kill Xiang Yuan. Murong Dieyi felt a surge of excitement at the thought.&nbsp;</p><p>In the author's note, the author promises to work hard to release new chapters and asks for readers' support in terms of engagement and feedback.</p>

            <p>Chapter 4: Is this Sixth? Completely Overpowering Fourth, Xiangyuan!&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Xia Qingxuan looked at Su Changqing and Xiangyuan, who were causing the world to tremble and the void to shatter as they fought endlessly, her expression filled with shock and disbelief.&nbsp;</p><p>"His sixth...is not just due to his strength being ranked sixth!" She was astounded, as what she was currently witnessing was too incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially with every move Su Changqing made, it was as if the surrounding space was collapsing! Facing Xiangyuan, ranked fourth on the list of outstanding geniuses, he seemed to be...slightly ahead!&nbsp;</p><p>Beside her, Xia Yilin was already feeling frightened, his eyes opened wide. "Su Changqing...is so strong!?"&nbsp;</p><p>The attacks they caused just by being near each other were enough to make people unable to bear it! In other words, if Su Changqing had wanted to, he could have easily eliminated him earlier...&nbsp;</p><p>But...&nbsp;</p><p>As he watched, Xia Yilin's expression was filled with confusion, and he couldn't help but ask, "Sis, is there something wrong with Su Changqing?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Why...does he always say things that people can't understand?" &nbsp;</p><p>He remembered the nonsensical things that Su Changqing had said before, which had left him confused.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xia Qingxuan shook her head, keeping her eyes on Su Changqing the whole time. "We'll talk about it later, you'll understand..."&nbsp;</p><p>She felt a bit shaken inside, and her response was surprised. From start to finish, Su Changqing didn't seem like he was pretending! &nbsp;</p><p>He was able to understand his brother's moves clearly, and even knew his nickname by heart. When Xiangyuan appeared, he could even clearly record everything he would do in the future, everything that would happen...&nbsp;</p><p>For some reason, she no longer felt as skeptical as she did before, and even began to believe him!&nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>And in countless gazes, every time Su Changqing made a move, it was incredibly vicious!&nbsp;</p><p>"In this life...I won't let the same thing happen again..." He pretended to be firm, murmuring under his breath.&nbsp;</p><p>With a sudden slap, the void trembled, and everything around him paled in comparison!&nbsp;</p><p>The immense killing intent shrouded the entire scene, causing countless people's scalp to explode!&nbsp;</p><p>Xiangyuan, who was recently feeling bewildered, but now appeared somewhat embarrassed, faced Su Changqing without holding back his strength. He felt that his previous descriptions were incomprehensible, and he couldn't understand a thing. From the beginning till now, it seemed like he was speaking to himself, and he couldn't make sense of anything!&nbsp;</p><p>To make matters worse, the strength that Su Changqing showed now made people's scalp tingle!&nbsp;</p><p>The guy who ranked sixth on the list...</p><p>Wow, how could he be so powerful?! As the situation grew more and more unfavorable, a sense of desperation appeared in Xiangyuan's eyes behind his mask. He shouted, "Soul-Devouring Curse, release!!!" A surge of demonic power enveloped him while countless demons thundered and lightning flashed across the sky. In the meantime, Xiangyuan muttered something under his breath, barely audible to the ears. The void then exploded as colossal demon images rushed into his body. The earth shook, and people around watched his body grow bigger and his aura skyrocketed. "You will lose this battle!!!" He gasped for air and spoke in a hoarse voice while staring at Su Changqing, his eyes shining with a ghastly light from behind the mask. Obviously, he wanted to end this confrontation as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>As Su Changqing saw Xiangyuan's body grow bigger, he realized that Xiangyuan was transforming into a deity of sorts. "The Annihilation Finger!" Su Changqing exclaimed, a hint of excitement flashing in his eyes. Although Xiangyuan was not originally an antagonist in the text, he had made an antagonistic move, which justified Su Changqing's decision to kill him. Moreover, the fabricated identity he was given had no issues. Therefore, without thinking much, Su Changqing gathered all the power in his body and released it without reservation, causing the entire dojo to collapse, even the protective barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, Su Changqing pointed his finger towards Xiangyuan, creating a shockwave that sent everyone reeling. The appearance of the finger made the crowd gasp in awe, and they couldn't stop trembling. They felt the power of death emanating from Su Changqing's attack. The sound of an explosion echoed through the void, scaring Xiangyuan. Although he had used a forbidden technique from the demon clan, he now felt his confidence diminish as he watched the monstrous finger of destruction come for him.&nbsp;</p><p>"What is this?!" Xiangyuan's mind went blank as he looked at the finger bearing the aura of destruction.</p><p>Is This the Ultimate Move!?
As the enormous finger descended, Xiangyuan's body trembled and the surrounding space seemed to be directly imprisoned!
"How...how is this possible!? Your cultivation is..." Beneath the mask, his expression changed drastically, his face white as a sheet!
Now, Su Changqing finally revealed his ultimate move, once again suppressing Xiangyuan.
Intense feelings of crisis surged through Xiangyuan, who had even used the most powerful secret technique of the Yao race, yet it was useless!
"He...he wants to kill me!" He looked at Su Changqing's indifferent eyes, his mind trembling!
Only at this moment did he realize that it was all his own wishful thinking!
Su Changqing's strength was not weaker than his, and even...far exceeded his!!!
Under the Finger of Annihilation, Xiangyuan's scalp exploded, and he trembled violently under the huge finger emitting a terrifying aura!
At this moment, he was unable to move!!!
"Boom! Boom! Boom!"
The void shattered inch by inch!
As the Finger of Annihilation approached,
"Bang!"
Under the trembling of the huge demon body, Xiangyuan's arm exploded into blood mist!
And the mask on his face began to shatter, revealing his gruesome and pale, half-man-half-demon face, filled with horror!
Seeing Xiangyuan spitting blood and his breath wilting...
Among the immortal Yao race, "Young friend, this is where it ends!"
"If our young tribe leader is harmed, I am afraid that the Dao One Sage Sect cannot bear the fury of the Yao race!"
"The old man doesn't mind leaving you here!"
An old voice came out, and a figure flashed, appearing in front of Xiangyuan, who had been completely suppressed.
And on his body, there was an even more terrifying aura than Su Changqing's!
Supreme Realm!!!
This person was Xiangyuan's Dao Protector!
The appearance of the old man was just a wave of his hand.
"Bang!"
His annihilation finger full of destructive power collapsed, and the attack was completely gone.

            <p>In Chapter 1: The Trust Value Increases, The Saintess is my Dao Companion!&nbsp;</p><p>The Daoist Holy Sect.
The peak of the Saint's son,
In the palace.&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing's mouth curled up into a smile as he thought about how shocked these female leads would be upon reading the diary entries he fabricated. "I bet their reactions will be quite interesting." Su Changqing chuckled. Although some of the things he made up may seem questionable and flawed, he considered them to be better than a lot of the plotlines in "Nine Mysterious Realms".&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, a sound could be heard in Su Changqing's head: "Ding! The host's diary is effective! All three diary holders have shaken and produced trust values! The current trust values of the diary holders are..." Su Changqing murmured to himself, feeling pleased with the results. "Lin Qianshuang has 50 trust points, the other two have 30..." He was surprised that the princess of the Great Feather Dynasty only had 30 trust points. In the original story, she was undoubtedly a cute and innocent little girl. However, it was understandable since she just received a duplicate of the diary and had only seen the fabricated storylines.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the Holy Mother of the Demon Sect, Murong Dieyi, Su Changqing wasn't surprised that she only had 30 trust points. She was known to be a skeptical and aloof person. Su Changqing was quite satisfied with the current trust value of his target. After all, she was the most outstanding disciple in the Demon Sect for thousands of years and would certainly achieve greatness in the future. If he could gain her trust, it would be a great thing for him!&nbsp;</p><p>However, what surprised Su Changqing the most was the Saintess Lin Qianshuang, who had a trust value of 50! "If I remember correctly, this Saintess has always had a special feeling for me and even wanted to pursue me." Su Changqing thought with a smirk. This was a perfect opportunity for him to take advantage of her feelings for him.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Su Changqing was pleased with the progress he had made in gaining trust from the diary holders. He would continue to work toward increasing their trust values in any way possible.</p><p>As a translator, here is my translation:&nbsp;</p><p>"Galloping in one's own footsteps..." 
"Until the male lead arrived and the braindead author forced the holy maiden to become foolish, causing her to break up with herself and become the male lead's follower..." 
"But compared to now, she still favors herself more, her trust value is higher, which is normal..." 
Su Changqing's mouth curled up as he muttered to himself. 
However, he didn't care about those plots. 
After all, 
He had already crossed over to this anti-hero prince, and things were bound to change in the future! 
Taking advantage of the trust he had gained so far, 
Su Changqing did not dwell too much on it and continued to add to this diary. 
"[It's over... It's all over. Let's just pretend it's a dream!]" 
"[It's better now. A million years ago at this time, I was still a holy prince. This feeling... it's been so long!]" 
"[Now that nothing has happened, it's great. It's time to relax...]" 
"[I really hope the Dark Chaos won't come and let me truly and comfortably live my life!]" 
... 
On the other side, 
On the summit of the Holy Maiden Peak. 
Ling Qianxue looked at the diary copy without the rest of the text and became somewhat frantic! 
"What about the rest? What else is there?" 
"Su Changqing... This guy was reborn and his memories have been restored. He should know too many things related to the future, right?" 
"The Dao One Holy Sect in the future, should have been destroyed too, right?" 
She had originally returned to her senses from shock and was planning to see if Su Changqing would reveal more information. 
But after waiting for a while, the diary still had not been updated. 
This made her uneasy. 
At this moment, 
"Your Holy Maiden, you should go to the Enlightenment Hall today..." 
A maid's voice came from outside. 
Hearing this, 
Ling Qianxue stared straight at the diary copy, shaking her head without hesitation. "Not going today. Let's talk about it tomorrow." 
As soon as she spoke, 
The maid waiting outside was stunned, hardly believing her ears. 
"Not going???" 
She took a deep breath, what was going on with the Holy Maiden? 
Since her mistress had become the Holy Maiden, there had not been a day when she hadn't gone to the Enlightenment Hall to practice. 
No matter what, rain or shine. 
But today... 
She's not going? 
Meanwhile, Ling Qianxue's mind was filled with the contents of the diary. 
"Dark Chaos... Bounded Seas of the Divine Realm... The future is not only the Nine Profound Heavens, but all the worlds will be devastated and reduced to nothingness..." 
The more she thought about it, the more shocked she became, and she couldn't help but have the idea of finding Su Changqing! 
As long as she found this guy to ask, she might be able to learn more, right? 
But after careful consideration... 
Ling Qianxue shook her head and took a deep breath.</p><p>"Sorry, I cannot translate the last line of the text as it is not in Chinese. However, I can translate and refine the rest of the text for you. Here is the translated and refined version:&nbsp;</p><p>"No, I can't go and look for him like this. If he finds out that I can see his diary, who knows what might happen..." Ling Qianxue muttered to herself and quickly dismissed the idea. Su Changqing was ruthless and his strength surpassed her own. Though he didn't speak much on a regular basis, once he took action, he was swift and decisive in his killings. He even possessed a physique that was deemed classified information within the sect, which had yet to be revealed to the public. Going to ask him about the future would not work!&nbsp;</p><p>Just as Ling Qianxue's curiosity was getting the best of her, the diary updated once again. "This guy..." she thought as she read the new content and envisioned Su Changqing's perfect appearance and talent that even numerous geniuses looked up to. The fact that he was able to hold on until the last moment before failure was proof that his achievements in the future would surpass hers. She wondered what was going to happen to her next? This thought made her feel a little dissatisfied. Was she not able to hold on until the last moment of the Dark Chaos?&nbsp;</p><p>However, the copy of the diary was updated once again, interrupting her thoughts. She quickly read it. "Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have been reborn and the sect is still the same sect from thousands of years ago! And I am still the only supreme saint since the establishment of the sect... Ling Qianxue should still be trying to catch up to my footsteps, right? Looking back now... it's quite interesting. This arrogant and aloof saintess will actually become my dao companion in the future..."&nbsp;</p><p>When Su Changqing said that Ling Qianxue was still trying to catch up to his footsteps, she trembled slightly but could not deny it. "Su Changqing, just wait, I...what!?" She gritted her teeth but suddenly widened her eyes!&nbsp;</p><p>As for the last line of the text, it is either incomplete or illegible. Please provide the complete text for me to translate."</p>

            <p>Chapter One: Saint Tier Technique, Turmoil in the Heart of the Saintess!&nbsp;</p><p>In the Scripture Pavilion of the Dao One Holy Sect, all disciples have the privilege of selecting the technique they desire. However, they are categorized into different levels, with the higher levels requiring higher qualifications for entry.&nbsp;</p><p>The third level is where the ordinary outer sect disciples frequent. It was at this moment that a graceful figure appeared on the third level of the Scripture Pavilion.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon seeing the person, the entire scene fell silent. Everyone stared in disbelief at the figure standing by the entrance. It was none other than Ling Qianxue, the Saintess of the Dao One Holy Sect.&nbsp;</p><p>Why would the Saintess come to the third level? With her status, she could easily access the highest level of the Scripture Pavilion to pick the best technique. However, at this moment, she appeared in the third level instead.&nbsp;</p><p>The disciples gasped in shock, amazed by what they were witnessing. "How can the Saintess be here?" "This is the first time!" "What is she trying to do? She shouldn't be here." The commotion around the scene was overwhelming. They couldn't believe what they were seeing.&nbsp;</p><p>To them, the Saintess was an entity of lofty status with an illustrious future. She shouldn't be present on the third level of the Scripture Pavilion.&nbsp;</p><p>As the people around her talked, Ling Qianxue didn't pay attention to them. Instead, she immediately began searching for the technique she had to find - the Xuan Yin Technique.&nbsp;</p><p>Her mind was full of the solution that Su Changqing had given her. She checked every area to find Xuan Yin Technique. If Su Changqing's words were true, then the Xuan Yin Technique she sought would be the answer to her current predicament.&nbsp;</p><p>After some time, she finally found the Xuan Yin Technique in a dusty corner. Without any hesitation, Ling Qianxue picked up the technique and blew off the dust.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is it!" Her eyes were filled with urgency and, mysteriously, with a sense of calm. She felt a sense of inner peace upon discovering the technique that would provide a solution to her troubles.&nbsp;</p><p>Without delay, she left the Scripture Pavilion after finding the technique, leaving everyone in awe.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Saintess took a low-level technique?" "Is that the Xuan Yin Technique I saw her take? But why would it be of any use to the Saintess?" The other disciples were puzzled by Ling Qianxue's actions and couldn't begin to fathom her reasoning.&nbsp;</p><p>News of Ling Qianxue's search for a low-level technique in the third level of the Scripture Pavilion began to spread around the Dao One Holy Sect. It shook the entire holy sect. &nbsp;</p><p>... &nbsp;</p><p>On the Saintess Peak,</p><p>After returning to her room, Ling Qianxue wasted no time in practicing the Xuan Yin Jue, believing more and more in what Su Changqing had told her. As she circulated her inner energy, an even more powerful cold energy erupted from within her. The noise was deafening as Ling Qianxue, with her training aptitude, mastered the Xuan Yin Jue in no time. She was amazed at how her cold energy had been calmed as Su Changqing had said, and she believed she was now strong enough to break through to the seventh level of the Divine King.&nbsp;</p><p>The room around her was covered in frost, a result of her training. She realized that if she hadn't followed Su Changqing's advice, she would have been consumed by the cold energy and her progress would have been reversed. Suddenly, the Xuan Yin Jue in front of her began to glow and rise into the air, creating a dazzling light. After a short while, a strong power emanated from the Xuan Yin Jue. To Ling Qianxue's amazement, the three words "Xuan Yin Jue" disappeared, replaced by an even more mysterious Tai Yin Jiuxuan.&nbsp;</p><p>As this high-level martial art appeared, the void shook. Ling Qianxue was stunned to realize that this was actually a broken Saint-level martial art. She had felt something was missing when training with the Xuan Yin Jue, but she had no inkling that it was a Saint-level martial art. This discovery explained why her cold energy had been eased and how she had become more powerful, enabling her to confidently break through the seventh level of the Divine King. Ling Qianxue became aware that the practice's grade was represented by the dark and yellow color of the sky, with higher-level martial arts beyond Dark, like Divine, Saint, and Immortal levels. She was surprised to find a Saint-level martial art in the third level of the library.&nbsp;</p><p>The martial art was already Saint-level in its incomplete state, but it could potentially reach Immortal-level after restoration. Ling Qianxue had to admit that Su Changqing's diary was accurate, but she couldn't believe she was Su Changqing's future wife. The thought made her blush, and she wished no one could see her blush like a little girl. Once her composure was regained, Ling Qianxue discovered more on Muren Diyi, the witch of the Sea Ghost Sect, and was completely puzzled by what she found.</p><p>It seems this person, Su Changqing, has connections everywhere! First it was the princess of the Daway dynasty, and now there is another person, Murong Dieyi. Ling Qianshuang has heard of Murong Dieyi, who is a witch belonging to the Muzong sect and has spilled the blood of many fellow sect members.&nbsp;</p><p>Ling Qianshuang couldn't help but show a hint of anger on her face and snorted before turning away. She was about to make a breakthrough to become a god king, and now it's just one step away.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Suoyuwei was still in shock and dazed after hearing about Su Changqing's resurrection from 10,000 years in the future. She couldn't believe that her weakness and illness were due to Su Changqing's words, and to make matters worse, he even knew about her having phoenix powers!&nbsp;</p><p>As Su Changqing continued to give out specific information regarding the situation of Ling Qianshuang, and offered solutions, Suoyuwei was even more shocked. She couldn't help but exclaim, "What? He's even the husband of that witch?"&nbsp;</p><p>"How many partners does Su Changqing have in the future? I, Ling Qianshuang from the Dao Yi sect, added with Murong Dieyi... " She couldn't help but feel angry, thinking that Su Changqing is just a playboy.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly there were footsteps approaching, and a magnetic voice was heard saying, "Wei'er." In walked a middle-aged man with a strong aura, looking imposing.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing the new arrival, Suoyuwei immediately came back down to earth and asked in surprise, "Father, what brings you here?"&nbsp;</p><p>"I came to see my precious daughter," said Su Qingyun, his imposing demeanor dissipating instantly.&nbsp;</p><p>When Suoyuwei heard her father's response, she was relieved that even her diary couldn't be seen by him. "Father... there's something I want to ask you!"&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing's words needed to be verified, so Suoyuwei asked her father whether she really had the phoenix seal on her forehead, and whether he really sealed her phoenix power.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon hearing her daughter's question, Su Qingyun looked puzzled but nodded and said, "Sure, go ahead and ask."&nbsp;</p><p>"Father, can you tell me honestly if the seal on my forehead is the phoenix seal and if I still possess the phoenix power that you sealed?" Suoyuwei pointed to the mark on her eyebrows and asked her doubts.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the story is left incomplete, and it's not clear what happens next.</p><p>Su Qingyun's face changed suddenly, astonished, as she looked at her daughter in front of her. "Wei'er... how did you know?" &nbsp;</p><p>"Daddy, never mind how I found out, just answer me... is it true or not?" &nbsp;</p><p>"...Yes, it's true. When you were born, there were three days of unusual phenomena and a divine phoenix appeared, entering your body. But its power was too great, so I sealed it away, intending to tell you when you were older. I didn't expect you to already know..." &nbsp;</p><p>Originally planning on finding excuses to evade the question, Su Qingyun let out a sigh at the sight of her daughter's serious expression and could only nod and tell her the truth of what happened all those years ago. &nbsp;</p><p>In other news, the author of this story has released a new book, while the previous one has concluded after two million words.

            <p>Chapter 1: What Happened in the Future, Don't Stop Updating!&nbsp;</p><p>As Ling Qianxue's figure disappeared into the distance, Su Changqing's lips curved into a smile as he shook his head. "Everything is going in the direction I anticipated," he mused, feeling as though everything was within his grasp. Regardless, he would live an exciting life in this new world he had travelled to.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other side, in the Da Yu dynasty, Su Youwei, who had been recuperating, was shocked when she saw the updated diary entry. "The Holy Daughter of the Dao Yi sect died to save Su Changqing?" she exclaimed in disbelief, her eyes growing wider. How tragic was the future she had yet to witness?&nbsp;</p><p>But when Su Changqing mentioned that the person he most wanted to see was Ling Qianxue, it made her heart ache with a tinge of jealousy. However, she chose to ignore it and pushed that thought aside. She didn't know why she would feel this way, and it made her look troubled.&nbsp;</p><p>The more she read, the more Su Youwei felt that she should not have read the diary's contents. "So inspiring..." she muttered to herself. "After all this time, Su Changqing hasn't forgotten about Ling Qianxue. But why didn't he mention me? Wasn't I his Dao companion after her?"&nbsp;</p><p>She was moved by what Su Changqing expressed in the diary, but once she snapped out of it, she gnashed her teeth in anger. "That despicable Su Changqing! Why isn't he thinking of me?"&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, Su Youwei's jealousy got the better of her, and she huffed with dissatisfaction, her face turning red as she stamped her feet. "What about me? What will happen to me in the future?" She stared intently at the diary, hoping to glean more information about her future. However, there were no further updates, which made her angry and pouty. "That horrid Su Changqing! He stinks!"&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, the diary flickered a few times, and Su Youwei read on with anticipation.
"I'm so happy to see Master Ling Qianxue again..."
"I wonder when I'll see Su Youwei and Diyi again?"
"If things continue as they have before, it might be a while before I see them again."
"Before the darkness and chaos of the future, Ling Qianxue, Su Youwei, Diyi and I had a life that could be likened to that of immortals. Everyone in the universe envied us!"
"In the morning, they would wake me up, and at night, we could fall asleep together. Every day was filled with new things, and we lived a happy life."
"I miss them..."</p><p>As she read through the updated content, Su Youwei couldn't help but feel satisfied, though she couldn't help but wonder if her reincarnation would bring about any changes to her current life. Regardless, she knew that in this life, she wanted to meet her companions of the past earlier and live a blissful life as a divine couple.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, in the land of the Mo Clan, the witch Murong Dieyi had just finished her daily cultivation and was excited upon reaching the level of a saint. She had heard of Su Changqing's recent breakthrough into the same level and was anticipating a chance to cross paths with him someday - her bloodline of ancient demons had given her an edge even against nine elders of the Mo Clan.&nbsp;</p><p>But as she was lost in thought, a diary appeared before her. As she read on, she couldn't help but feel a sense of betrayal upon realizing that Su Changqing had written more about his longing for his junior apprentice sister Ling Qianshuang than for her. But as she continued reading, she was shocked to learn that Ling Qianshuang would eventually die due to Su Changqing's actions. This made her even more curious about what made Su Changqing so charismatic that would lead to such a heartrending tragedy.</p><p>"æ®µææ" - "Relationship Section?" &nbsp;</p><p>"What about the result?" &nbsp;</p><p>Curious, I continued reading... &nbsp;</p><p>"[I wish to meet them earlier in this life, become immortal soul mates and live happily ever after in this world!]â &nbsp;</p><p>As Murong Dieyi finished reading the text, her expression became a bit strange. &nbsp;</p><p>"What about my future? Since I couldn't stay by Su Changqing's side forever, what happened next? Does that mean I only traveled with Zhu Changqing because I couldn't accept the other two women?" &nbsp;</p><p>After thinking for a while, a hint of blush appeared on Murong Dieyi's icy face. &nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing, why are you so good at teasing me?" &nbsp;</p><p>She was a little annoyed, but couldn't ask directly. This led to her being very curious about what her future would hold. &nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, Murong Dieyi felt a strong sense of anticipation. &nbsp;</p><p>Just as she was about to put her thoughts aside, Murong Dieyiâs spirit was lifted by the next entry in Su Changqing's diary. &nbsp;</p><p>"[If there hadn't been the dusk invasion and the dark turmoil that destroyed all the worlds, how great would it have been?] &nbsp;</p><p>[We...must have walked hand in hand throughout our lives, relying on each other for support.] &nbsp;</p><p>[We'd have a few chubby boys, a few little girls; our family would travel through various worlds, experiencing all sorts of adventures...] &nbsp;</p><p>[It's too bad, there's no 'if'...]" &nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing's diary was updated again, once again igniting Murong Dieyi's curiosity. &nbsp;</p><p>"Invasion... turmoil..." &nbsp;</p><p>"What will the future be like?" &nbsp;</p><p>Her expression became distracted as she once again remembered what she previously read about the future in the diary. &nbsp;</p><p>What sort of future will it be?! &nbsp;</p><p>After taking a deep breath, Murong Dieyi focused her attention on the diary, ignoring all other thoughts. &nbsp;</p><p>"What about later? What about later??" &nbsp;</p><p>Her impatience got the better of her, and she wanted to know the truth immediately... &nbsp;</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;</p><p>The old author has published a new book and is committed to regular updates with guaranteed quality! &nbsp;</p><p>The new book is in desperate need of support! &nbsp;</p><p>Please show support with flowers, reviews or comments, and help the author with your encouragement. &nbsp;</p><p><crip i="halfHi_crip">$(".").la().ala("halfHi");iou(fu(){$(".oE").la().bfor("Click to continue reading more exciting content in this novel, keep reading...</p>

            <p>Chapter 1: Simple Crit Rebate, Plot Changed by Magic!&nbsp;</p><p>At these words, Mu Rong Butterfly frowned and glanced at the girl behind her, then turned to Su Changqing with a look of confusion. "Why is that?" she asked, not so much questioning as genuinely puzzled.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm here in front of you now. Shouldn't you talk to me more?" he replied silently. "Why are you suddenly concerned about another girl?"&nbsp;</p><p>As a disciple of the Demon Sect, Xi Ya was also staring blankly at the floating pill bottle in front of her. "Saint Dao, you..." she said, looking at Su Changqing with surprise, her heart shaking. This Saint had seen her problem just at a glance? So strong!&nbsp;</p><p>And the effect of the Heaven-Defying Gathering Spirit Pill was to consolidate one's own foundation, at a high price. But the other party had just put out five of them...&nbsp;</p><p>After getting permission from the Witch, Xi Ya took the pill bottle tremblingly, feeling grateful and thankful as she bowed and said, "Thank you, Saint!"&nbsp;</p><p>It was at this moment that Su Changqing looked at Xi Ya, who was pleased as punch, with a complicated look in his eyes. "I didn't expect her to become an investor..." he thought to himself in amazement.&nbsp;</p><p>Because in the original text, this Xi Ya was loyal and courageous, not even afraid of death! She was one of the more outstanding characters!&nbsp;</p><p>But now, he immediately made up a story in his diary!&nbsp;</p><p>"[Xi Ya...] I remember her."&nbsp;</p><p>"[She will be a capable assistant by Mu Rong Butterfly's side in the future, loyal and dedicated. Even in the chaos of the war between the heavens, she will fight alone against the enemies that come to besiege her, sacrificing herself if necessary!" &nbsp;</p><p>"[It was her desperate resistance, fighting to the end at the cost of her life, that allowed Mu Rong Butterfly to break through the enemy lines in the end.]"&nbsp;</p><p>"[I never would have thought that, as a simple disciple of the Demon Sect, she would achieve such great things in the future...]"&nbsp;</p><p>As the diary was updated, Mu Rong Butterfly also saw the contents that were synchronized with the diary copy.&nbsp;</p><p>"So that's how it is..." she murmured, looking at the content Su Changqing had written in his diary. She understood why Su Changqing was so kind to a small disciple of the Demon Sect.&nbsp;</p><p>It turned out that in the future, during the war between the heavens, Xi Ya sacrificed herself to buy time for her own breakthrough. Although her heart was shaken, Mu Rong Butterfly did not show it, but instead looked calmly at Xi Ya and asked, "From now on, will you follow me willingly?"&nbsp;</p><p>"I...I'm willing! I'm willing!!!" Xi Ya hesitated for a moment, before immediately replying without hesitation. A Witch was actually asking her to follow her! This was fantastic! It must be the Saint Dao's credit, otherwise how could she have stumbled upon such a good thing!</p><p>Su Changqing didn't pay much attention to the gratitude in the other person's eyes, as his mind was filled with the system's message: "Congratulations host, successful investment, and acquisition of Xi Ya's grateful heart!" and "Congratulations host, received a surprise critical hit -- Qian Yuan Dragon Soul Pill!" The Qian Yuan Dragon Soul Pill is a pill that contains a strand of true dragon soul, with powerful medicinal effects, which should be taken with caution. If used in the practice of the True Dragon Technique, the results would be twice the effort for half the work. This time, Su Changqing was surprised by the critical hit. After learning the effects of the medicine, he was overjoyed and exclaimed, "The Qian Yuan Dragon Soul Pill? This is amazing!" He was extremely pleased to put it away in his storage space. However, due to the overpowering nature of the True Dragon Technique, after acquiring it, he did not rush to practice it. With these Qian Yuan Dragon Soul Pills, he would have no problem practicing in the future. &nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, at Tai Xu Holy Land, in the assessment square, Lin Fan was venting his frustrations. He was currently taking part in the second assessment's brawl, with only the top ten survivors qualifying for the next round. His unbridled arrogance earned him the scornful glares of his fellow participants. In the ring, Yu Lao couldn't help but be extremely frustrated as he asked, "If you continue to act like this, who will be able to save you later?" Before Lin Fan arrived, Yu Lao had told him to keep a low profile and not to be too ostentatious. But, he just didn't listen. He was already attacking the people around him, thinking that nobody could stop him. He assumed that even if he couldn't beat the others, nobody would dare to touch him since the Holy Maiden of the Dao Yi Holy Land wasn't present, and because Su Changqing was capable of suppressing the former top five of the Tianjiao List on his own. &nbsp;</p><p>At that moment, Su Changqing was spending time with Murong Dieyi, trying to deepen their relationship, when he was interrupted by the commotion of the surrounding area. "Hm? Who is that?" He glanced over and saw Lin Fan. Unexpectedly, Lin Fan had also come to the Tai Xu Holy Land! Upon seeing Su Changqing's surprise, Murong Dieyi also noticed the figure performing well in the chaotic assessment.</p><p>Lin Fan's Eyes.
"Do you know him?" she asked, no longer as reserved as when they first met.
In response, Su Changqing smiled and shook his head, opting to write in his diary.
"Lin Fan... one of the reasons that led to the start of the collapse of the future war. How did he end up here?"
"He fled before and didn't expect to end up here."
With the diary updated, Murong Dieyi also saw the synchronised copy.
"What? He's Lin Fan!?" Seeing the name, she remembered the Collapse War that led to the demise of the Demon Sect!
In an instant, she was furious!
She couldn't believe that he had also come to participate in the ceremony!
Glancing at Su Changqing in front of her, Murong Dieyi took a deep breath, her expression icy.
"I remember this person! Lin Fan, the one who killed our Demon Sect. I can't believe he's here!"
"Saint, let me take care of this matter first..."
She took a deep breath, then got up and led the Demon Sect away straight to the Tai Xu Sacred Land!
This guy must be eliminated!
She couldn't allow the future that Su Changqing spoke of to happen!
Seeing this scene, Su Changqing nodded on the surface, but was already overjoyed in his heart.
"The plot has been changed!" he thought while looking at the figure still desperately trying to perform.

But before he could say anything...&nbsp;</p><p>"Who is Su Changqing!?" A loud voice suddenly rang out from not far away!&nbsp;</p><p>Instantly, everyone looked towards the direction of Beiming Holy Land, where they saw a young man standing next to Xia Qingxuan.&nbsp;</p><p>"Whoosh!" Surprised, they all then turned to where the disciples of Dao Yi Holy Sect were.&nbsp;</p><p>Noticing all eyes were on them, Xia Yilin immediately locked onto Su Changqing, who was next to Mu Rong Die Yi.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's you!" He laughed loudly, leaped up, and created a gust of wind straight towards Su Changqing!&nbsp;</p><p>His overwhelming aura made many people pale.&nbsp;</p><p>Mu Rong Die Yi saw Xia Yilin's impulsive action and furrowed her eyebrows slightly. But before she could do anything, she saw Su Changqing shaking his head at her.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing this, she understood. Since Su Changqing was Xia Qingxuan's future husband, wasn't this person supposed to address Su Changqing as his brother-in-law?&nbsp;</p><p>Soon enough, Xia Yilin was in front of Su Changqing, scrutinizing him up and down.&nbsp;</p><p>"You, let's fight!" He blinked and said seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>This time, he came here for Su Changqing! Due to the presence of the fairy-tale spirit root in his body, his cultivation was not just at the early stage of the Holy Realm, it was far stronger than that of an average Saint.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as he spoke, the scene erupted.&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing looked at Xia Yilin and his straightforward attitude. "This guy..." he thought inwardly, naturally recognizing him.&nbsp;</p><p>In the original text, Xia Yilin is Xia Qingxuan's younger brother, with a fairy-tale spirit root, plus the son of the Beiming Holy Land's Holy Lord. Therefore, while others went from low to high on the journey of enlightenment, this guy was already a Saint as soon as he made his appearance.&nbsp;</p><p>To put it simply, he was born into privilege.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Xia Yilin did not end up partnering with the protagonist in the original text but rather was at odds with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Isn't an enemy's enemy a friend?&nbsp;</p><p>Although this guy was slightly arrogant, it was only due to his naivety. He wouldn't be like this when he grew up.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, he lacked the tough love of society.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing that Su Changqing didn't react, Xia Yilin furrowed his brows, indicating his motive. "Hey, are you going to fight or not?"&nbsp;</p><p>"I came for you. My sister is ranked fifth on the Heavenly Genius List, and I want to be on it too!"&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't care about the other guys. You're sixth, perfect. Defeat you, and I'll make my mark!"&nbsp;</p><p>"You're my first opponent after entering the mortal realm. It's the beginning of my invincible path!"</p><p>"From the moment you start!" he exclaimed confidently. His words caused a commotion among those around him, and people began to exclaim with surprise. Even Mu Rong Die Yi couldn't help but become curious. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the people from the North Ming Holy Land also approached. Xia Qing Xuan gave Xia Yi Lin a white look and glanced at Su Chang Qing. But for some reason, she couldn't think of anything to say, and her mind went back to the content of her diary. &nbsp;</p><p>Amid the gaze of everyone, Su Chang Qing looked at Xia Yi Lin, who was clearly eager to begin, and smiled lightly, saying, "With those words...it's possible that your invincible journey will end before it even begins." &nbsp;</p><p>Xia Yi Lin was taken aback and asked naively, "What do you mean?" &nbsp;</p><p>"Because...among our peers, I am the only one who can stand out and be unrivaled," Su Chang Qing said calmly, with a flat tone that caused a huge sensation among the audience! &nbsp;</p><p>The people from various sacred sites looked at the scene with no ripples on Su Chang Qing's face, feeling scared. Even the sons and godchildren from their own sects couldn't speak up, even if they were uncomfortable listening. &nbsp;</p><p>After all, this guy had swept the top five people on the original list of Tian Jiao! &nbsp;</p><p>That was five people, not just one! &nbsp;</p><p>Mu Rong Die Yi was shocked, but then she smiled wryly. &nbsp;</p><p>"This guy..." &nbsp;</p><p>She was inexplicably excited by this tough talk. &nbsp;</p><p>Her future husband was so outstanding? &nbsp;</p><p>If it were someone else, she would have immediately intervened! &nbsp;</p><p>But the person who said this was Su Chang Qing, the sixth on the Tian Jiao list, and she was unsure. &nbsp;</p><p>... &nbsp;</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;</p><p>The author has released a new book and will absolutely work hard to update it frequently, with guaranteed quality! &nbsp;</p><p>The new book is seeking everyone's support in terms of data! &nbsp;</p><p>Flower reviews, votes, and comments are all welcome to give encouragement to the author.

It has no level restriction and no upper limit. The stronger the Host's strength, the greater the power of the technique. ]&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing was delighted to hear about the rewards. Especially at this moment, he received a lot of information about the Wasteland Destruction Finger technique in his mind, without even needing to comprehend it, he understood it completely! This investment has paid off!&nbsp;</p><p>However, this doesn't seem entirely accurate, as he has never lost an investment before...&nbsp;</p><p>At the event, everyone looked at Su Changqing, who had just sat back down, with shock in their eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>"This guy... does he really have no limits to his strength?"&nbsp;</p><p>"With his strength, he could easily compete for the first spot on the Heavenly Proud List!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Even that terrifying the Lightning-Bolted Immortal Spear had no effect on him. Is he still a human?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh my god, Su Changqing defeated others and even gave away Immortal-grade techniques?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Then... I want to challenge Su Changqing too, I don't need Immortal-grade, I'll take the Heaven-grade!"&nbsp;</p><p>"You? Are you looking for death? When you have a sister like the North Sea Saint, then you can talk!"&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, the whole scene was in an uproar. Countless cultivators were frightened by Su Changqing's strength and amazed.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially the fact that he gave away a Heaven-grade technique, which made many cultivators jealous and gossiped about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the commotion at the scene, Mu Rong Butterfly felt uncomfortable and gritted her teeth when she saw Xia Qingxuan's blank expression opposite her.&nbsp;</p><p>"Darn it, you've only just met and they're already giving away such expensive gifts..."&nbsp;</p><p>She turned her head and looked at Su Changqing, feeling annoyed. This guy was despicable!&nbsp;</p><p>No, first write down what happened! If they get together in the future, she will definitely bring this up again!&nbsp;</p><p>Noticing Mu Rong Butterfly's gaze, Su Changqing thought about what he should fabricate next. However...&nbsp;</p><p>Before he could come up with anything, there was a loud explosion in the sky above! Suddenly, he looked up and saw endless black mist enveloping the sky above the God's Palace. Slowly, figures wearing black robes and black masks hiding their faces began to appear.&nbsp;</p><p>In their eyes, there were gleams of light.&nbsp;</p><p>This scene shook the whole ceremony!&nbsp;</p><p>"Who are those people!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"This aura...</p><p>"This clothing, is it for the Immortal Demon Clan?!"  
"How did they get here?!"  
In an instant, shocked cries could be heard everywhere.  
Amidst everyone's gaze, the black-robed figure slowly descended from the sky.  
Among them, the leader scanned the scene and his gaze landed on Xia Yilin.  
"The son of the North Ming Saint Lord, Xia Yilin, is it?"  
"Just for you to attempt to walk the unbeatable path? How laughable!"  
Although he wore a mask, his young age and careless sneer could be heard in his words.  
From his words, it seemed as if he had arrived long before.  
Before the others could react, the man turned to face the direction where Su Changqing was, and said without any concealment: "Sixth on the Heavenly Pride List, the one who suppressed the top five on the original ranking, Dao One Holy Sect's Su Changqing!"  
"Today, you will fall by my hands!''  
The eyes beneath his mask flickered slightly, revealing a hint of strangeness.  
Upon hearing his words, the scene fell silent.  
However, Xia Yilin's face immediately filled with anger.  
"What did you say?!"  
"Who are you, daring to speak so arrogantly?!"  
He immediately drew out his Thunderbolt and Meteor Immortal Spear in a fit of rage, and was about to rush out!  
But suddenly, Xia Qingxuan grabbed him and her eyes turned cold.  
"The Immortal Demon Clan..."  
She felt the aura emanating from him, and her expression grew even colder.  
At this moment, she was certain of his identity.  
Upon hearing the black-robed man's words, Mu Rong Dieyi's magical energy surged.  
Before she could act, Su Changqing looked astonished and asked, "Who are you?"  
"Hmm? You don't know me?"  
The black-robed youth's tone sank, a hint of mockery in his eyes.  
Immediately, he took a step forward and the entire space shattered. The terrifying aura that belonged to him swept over everyone, like he wanted to suppress the entire world!  
Then, he stood in the void and looked coldly at Su Changqing, saying, "Fourth on the Heavenly Pride List, Xiang Yuan, has come to give you a lesson!"  
With that, a terrifying aura swept towards Su Changqing.  
However, Su Changqing casually waved his hand and the aura disappeared.  
For the others present, their eyes widened in shock.  
Everyone was stunned and exclaimed, "What?!"  
"This guy, this guy is actually fourth on the Heavenly Pride List? Rumour has it that he is likely to become the highest achievement of the Immortal Demon Clan and is highly regarded by the demons. He is Xiang Yuan?!"  
"Weren't the Immortal Demon Clan in seclusion? Now they've come because of Su Changqing?!"</p><p>"?" 
The entire ceremony erupted in excitement, with screams of amazement reverberating throughout the venue!

He wiped out the stumbling block in his future path without hesitation.&nbsp;</p><p>"Shua!"&nbsp;</p><p>In everyone's sight, he immediately took a step forward.&nbsp;</p><p>When he appeared, he was already in front of Xiangyuan!&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing this scene, the audience was shocked.&nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing...is he going to kill him!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Goodness, don't they really care about the fury of the demons!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"No way, no way? Is this the rhythm of war?!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"I think it's not wrong for Su Changqing to kill Xiangyuan. After all, Xiangyuan had already intended to kill Su Changqing before. No matter what, Su Changqing's current actions are perfectly fine..."&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone was nervous to the extreme, staring intently at Su Changqing.&nbsp;</p><p>Even Murong Dieyi and Xia Qingxuan, couldn't help being nervous as they looked at Su Changqing's figure.&nbsp;</p><p>In their opinion, all the things that Xiangyuan had done in the future deserved death, indeed!!&nbsp;</p><p>At this time, Su Changqing didn't hesitate too much, but slowly raised his hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing this, Xiangyuan's body trembled, panicking: "You...what are you going to do!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Kill the rebel!"&nbsp;</p><p>In order to match the fake diary he had written, Su Changqing coldly spoke and pointed at the motionless Xiangyuan.&nbsp;</p><p>On his fingertip, he concentrated all the power of the cultivation at the Third Heaven of the Saint Realm!&nbsp;</p><p>Xiangyuan felt an increasingly strong sense of danger, gasping thickly and heavily.&nbsp;</p><p>"No...no..."&nbsp;</p><p>His body couldn't move, unable to resist, constantly shaking his head.&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, he seemed no longer to be the young patriarch of the Undead Demons, but an ordinary person, who was afraid of death.&nbsp;</p><p>Ignoring Xiangyuan's pleading eyes, Su Changqing did not have any mercy, and his finger continued to drop downwards!&nbsp;</p><p>Not far away, Geng Mohan who saw this scene, had his eyes about to split open!&nbsp;</p><p>"How dare you!!!"&nbsp;</p><p>Even if his cultivation was being suppressed, he was desperate.</p><p>The Outbreak!
Young Clan Leader, you cannot die!
With a loud roar, he was about to break free from his restraints and go stop it!
However...
Dao Yi Saint Lord coldly snorted at this moment. The entire divine palace continuously exploded and an even more terrifying pressure descended!
Originally, Geng Mohan, who was about to break free, became even paler, firmly suppressed, and kneeling on the ruined Dao Field with his legs bent!
He spat out blood from the corners of his mouth, his eyes tearing apart, roaring towards Dao Yi Saint Lord in anger: "You all... you all from Dao Yi Sect really want to declare war with the Undead Demon Clan?!"
"But!" 
Dao Yi Saint Lord seemed impatient. Without waiting for Geng Mohan to finish speaking, he coldly said: "Declare war? Ridiculous..."
"Do you all think that the current Undead Demon Clan has the qualifications?!"
As soon as his voice stopped, the scene was immediately as quiet as death!
Geng Mohan's pupils shrank, his breathing became rapid.
"This... Dao Yi Sect..." 
He was shocked in his heart. Didn't the other party care at all?!
And at this moment, 
Su Changqing's fingers also landed on Xiang Yuan's forehead.
"Boom!"
This finger contained the power of the cultivation of three levels of saint realm. Even if it was the Supreme, it would be seriously injured without any defense at this moment!
The huge impact immediately swept through, creating bursts of violent wind!
Xiang Yuan's fear of death suddenly solidified after Su Changqing's finger landed. 
At this moment, his vitality had been completely destroyed by Su Changqing's terrifying spiritual power until even his soul had dissipated!
Even though he was still holding up his head now, his eyes quickly lost their luster and became empty!
Fourth place on the Heavenly Pride List, completely fallen!
When he saw Xiang Yuan's death, as a protector, Geng Mohan continuously trembled, staring at Su Changqing in anger and roaring: "Why, why did you kill him?!"
"Clan Leader, Clan Leader, I won't let you go, I won't let you go!!!"
With bloodshot eyes, he looked at Su Changqing with endless hatred!
He almost brought up Xiang Yuan himself!
But now he was watching him die in front of his eyes!
Anger and despair filled his heart!
As a Supreme realm cultivator, Geng Mohan felt deeply powerless at this moment!
No one had expected that Dao Yi Saint Lord would pay attention to Su Changqing at all times, and left behind a strand of soul to protect him! 
They didn't even hesitate to go to war with the Undead Demon Clan and kill the Young Clan Leader!!!
When Su Changqing heard Geng Mohan's roar, he turned his head to look at the other party. 
However, before he could say anything, 
"Boom!" 
Geng Mohan, without any warning, exploded into a blood mist!
And the one who went up with him...
Had long since</p><p>A group of immortal demons lost consciousness due to fear! "Bang! Bang! Bang..." Their bodies exploded one after another, turning into clusters of bloody mist! In an instant, the whole scene was filled with the smell of blood! At this moment, all the members of the undead demon clan who had come on this journey were completely wiped out! "Noisy!" The phantom image of the Saint Dao Master slowly uttered two words, without any emotional fluctuations in his tone. Su Changqing blinked and looked at the phantom of the Saint Dao Master with some surprise. Then, he pretended to look profound and reminisced about the past, saying quietly, "Old man, go easy on him. If his blood splashes on me, I'll find it dirty..." "That's the blood of a traitor..." He smelled the smell of blood in the air and murmured softly. He was not polite to the Saint Dao Master either, because in the original text, he and Ling Qianxue were brought up by the Saint Dao Master since they were young and were always treated as his own. One could say that the other was not only a father figure with no blood relations, but also a mentor who initiated him into the path of cultivation. When the phantom image of the Saint Dao Master heard Su Changqing's words, he just responded with a faint "good". However...everyone present was stunned by the conversation between the two of them. Whoever it was, they were all in shock watching the phantom of the Saint Dao Master and Su Changqing, who were standing amidst the haze in the shattered dojo. After killing the young patriarch of the undead demon clan, wiping out a supreme being and the members of the undead demon clan who had come this time, they were still able to communicate so calmly and peacefully! Looking at the two of them, it seemed like they didn't even care about this matter. As if... it was just a mundane small incident!... P.S.

            <p>Chapter One: Shock! The top five are all people spoken by Su Changqing!&nbsp;</p><p>Jiuxuan Tian,&nbsp;</p><p>Western Regions, Zixiao Taoist Palace.&nbsp;</p><p>The most mysterious Taoist sect in the entire Jiuxuan Tian, bar none.&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, countless disciples were staring in awe at the dazzling Tianjiao Leaderboard in the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Tianjiao Leaderboard has appeared... I'm afraid the world is going to be in chaos!"&nbsp;</p><p>Their faces were difficult to believe, not expecting this unexpected situation to arise.&nbsp;</p><p>Amidst the cries of astonishment...&nbsp;</p><p>A startlingly loud noise rang out from deep within the Taoist Palace, previously shrouded in ethereal mist.&nbsp;</p><p>In that very moment,&nbsp;</p><p>The sky above the Taoist Palace suddenly changed color!&nbsp;</p><p>What was once shining under the radiant brilliance of the Tianjiao Leaderboard, now plunged into darkness!&nbsp;</p><p>Then, a tremendous force shook the Taoist Palace violently, causing the earth and sky to tremble!&nbsp;</p><p>Terrifying, unstoppable pressure descended!&nbsp;</p><p>The winds and clouds churned from all sides, and a terrifying vortex filled with thunder appeared in the sky!&nbsp;</p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"&nbsp;</p><p>The deafening noise continued to echo, much like a Primordial Beast had awoken!&nbsp;</p><p>Under this immense pressure,&nbsp;</p><p>Not a single disciple in the entire Taoist Palace remained unfazed, their faces pale and their bodies trembling!&nbsp;</p><p>This energy seemed to represent the Heavenly Dao!!!&nbsp;</p><p>The elders all flew out, each staring intently at the deepest recesses of the Taoist Palace!&nbsp;</p><p>"This... this energy!!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Daâozi, he... could he be awakening?!"&nbsp;</p><p>"After all this time, he's finally... finally going to wake up?!"&nbsp;</p><p>"With Daozi's awakening, our Zixiao Taoist Palace need not remain obscure any longer..."&nbsp;</p><p>Even though their faces turned pale in the face of Heavenly Dao's energy, they trembled with excitement.&nbsp;</p><p>At the very depths of the Taoist Palace,&nbsp;</p><p>A beam of divine light descended from the sky,&nbsp;</p><p>Landing on a young man with a charming and ethereal feeling to him.&nbsp;</p><p>"Huh..."&nbsp;</p><p>After a moment, he slowly opened his bewildered eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>In his pupils seemed to contain endless Heavenly Thunder, overflowing with astonishing pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>This person,&nbsp;</p><p>Was the Daozi of Zixiao Taoist Palace, Wang Ye!&nbsp;</p><p>Soon...&nbsp;</p><p>Wang Ye's confused expression gradually turned normal, his calmness becoming terrifying.&nbsp;</p><p>"Tianjiao Leaderboard. Being on it means one has the Heavenly Dao's favor..."&nbsp;</p><p>He was clearly in a sealed-off forbidden area, yet he could see everything!&nbsp;</p><p>That Tianjiao Leaderboard...&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking of this,&nbsp;</p><p>Wang Ye chuckled lightly, slowly rising to his feet.&nbsp;</p><p>"After slumbering for so long, I should get some exercise..."&nbsp;</p><p>He murmured thoughtfully. The space beside him seemed unable to bear it, showing signs of collapse!&nbsp;</p><p>Then, in the next instant, he disappeared from his spot!</p><p>On the other side, in the desolate wilderness located to the east of the Nine Heavens, there was an ancient and enormous city that belonged to the Dragon Clan. The dragon-like beings, with human torsos and heads, but with tails, were looking up at the Heaven Pride Ranking in astonishment. "What the hell is going on?" they muttered to themselves. They couldn't believe that one day the Nine Heavens would create such a list, and the fact that being on the list would grant divine favor made countless individuals fervently desire it!&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous dragon roar echoed from the heart of an ancient and pitch-black tower located in the center of the city. The earth shuddered, and the terrible power of suppression from their bloodline made every Dragon person in the vicinity tremble and prostrate themselves on the ground. Moments later, a colossal black tower appeared overhead, a shadow that covered the sky and had wings.&nbsp;</p><p>In the deathly silence, a voice boomed from the tower, sending ripples of noise throughout the Nine Heavens: "The Heaven Pride Ranking? Ha ha ha, what an excellent ranking! Then let me kick off this generation's major powerhouses!"&nbsp;</p><p>Arrogant and rebellious voices continued to resound from the tower, shaking the entire Eastern Wasteland. Similarly, such events kept happening throughout the Nine Heavens domain, leaving no place untouched. That day was destined to be a tumultuous one, indeed, the most raucous day in many a year!&nbsp;</p><p>Many geniuses of the world, who had heretofore concealed themselves, emerged to show interest in the ranking. Particular sects, sacred individuals, and religious dynasties also became interested in the ranking and began to challenge those whose names were on the list.&nbsp;</p><p>Just three days later, the challengers surpassed the tenth and ninth ranked people on the Heaven Pride Ranking! And this change sparked much uproar and buzz. Five days later, the fifth-ranked name also faced a challenge and changed.&nbsp;</p><p>"The fifth name belongs to Xia Qingxuan, the daughter of the Saint Lord of the Beiming Holy Land!" The list kept fluctuating every few days as every challenger sought to seize a higher rank or a place on the list.&nbsp;</p><p>Before long, the four dominating powers whose champions had previously occupied the top spots erupted into a massive war. In half a month, the top five names underwent a complete reshuffle, and the top four became:&nbsp;</p><p>"Number One: Daozi Wang Ye, of the Purple Sky Dao Palace!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Number Two: Emperor Dragon Three, of the Ancient Dragon Kingdom!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Number Three: Xia Zilin, of the Forbidden Zone of the Mortal World!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Number Four: Shao Zulang, of the Immortal Clan!"&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, the Heaven Pride Ranking shook violently, shaking the entire domain of the Nine Heavens.</p><p>"Jiuxuantian! Countless people were horrified when they saw that the names of the top five had all been replaced. "What, what is this!?" "Oh my god, all of the top five have been replaced!?" "Now the top five all feel so unfamiliar!?" Every person looked at the unfamiliar names, feeling goosebumps. This was too shocking for them. The current top five on the leaderboard were unfamiliar to the vast majority of people. Even if they knew the powers they belonged to, they still didn't recognize the people on the list! In an instant, Jiuxuantian exploded! No one could have expected that the end of the ranking would be replaced on the genius list, let alone the original top five. Within half a month, they had all been replaced! Meanwhile, at the same time, at the Dao Yi Holy Sect, Ling Qianxue was also paying attention to the changes in the genius list on the sky curtain, her pupils shrinking! "How can this be..." When she saw the names on top, she breathed quickly. These names... aren't they the five people that senior brother mentioned in his diary!? They have taken action! And their speed is so fast, it's terrifying! Amidst the roar of the sky, "What else does senior brother know? How terrifying are these people's abilities!?" Ling Qianxue was deeply shocked. Besides the shock of those five strangers, what shocked her the most was that they dominated the top five as senior brother said. Her body trembled slightly, and her shock was indescribable! With the huge change in the rankings on the genius list, Ling Qianxue knew that Jiuxuantian was about to change drastically. "Has the chaotic world started at this moment!?" She remembered the contents of senior brother's diary and muttered. Besides the dark turmoil, everything senior brother mentioned in his diary had happened! P.S. The author has released a new book and is absolutely committed to updating it frequently with guaranteed quality! The new book begs for readers' support! Flowers, evaluations, votes, including comments, any support for the author would be appreciated. Thank you all!"</p>

            <p>Chapter 1: Reborn, I and the Desolation, the Ruthless One Failed!&nbsp;</p><p>What to fabricate?&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing's eyes kept flickering, and then he burst out with a strong look!&nbsp;</p><p>"As long as the diary is fabricated by me, it's enough to make the holder of the diary believe..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Since that's the case, why don't I just create an unprecedented story that surpasses everything in this world?!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, that's it!!!"&nbsp;</p><p>He took a deep breath, and his eyes shone even brighter.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, he had a general idea in his mind!&nbsp;</p><p>Without worrying too much about it,&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing immediately began to fabricate the diary according to the usage method that the system had given him before!&nbsp;</p><p>"My memory... has finally recovered..."&nbsp;</p><p>"This... Am I reborn? Back to ten thousand years ago?"&nbsp;</p><p>"The feeling of being young is so good!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Sure enough, the future me, the Desolation, the Ruthless One... we still failed!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Darkness, endless darkness!"&nbsp;</p><p>"The future heavens and myriad worlds have all shattered, and all living beings have been destroyed. We can't resist it!"&nbsp;</p><p>"That emperor in the darkness has already surpassed the existence of the Dao, crossing the boundary sea to destroy everything. But a wave is a world..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Now, am I back in the Nine Profound Heaven? Heh, it's really good. The weak world of the Nine Profound Heaven is still too small after all..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Heh, I didn't expect... We have paid so much, lost so much, but still lost!"&nbsp;</p><p>"I refuse to accept it, refuse to accept it!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Desolation, Ruthless One... Have you also been reborn like me?"&nbsp;</p><p>"So tired. Forget it. Since we can't change it, let's give up in this life and enjoy ourselves..."&nbsp;</p><p>In the diary,&nbsp;</p><p>The lines of text revealed despair and helplessness.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time,&nbsp;</p><p>In the Dao One Holy Sect,&nbsp;</p><p>In the fairy aura-filled hall beside Saint's Daughter Peak.&nbsp;</p><p>Ling Qianshu had just finished today's training and exhaled a breath.&nbsp;</p><p>"God King Seventh Heaven... is coming soon..."&nbsp;</p><p>She blinked, her beautiful face filled with a coldness, and frost formed around her body.&nbsp;</p><p>Hiding the icy breath, she looked at the void, as if her gaze had reached beyond the hall.&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing, I will catch up with you soon!&nbsp;</p><p>At this time,&nbsp;</p><p>Ling Qianshu withdrew her gaze, her eyes firm.&nbsp;</p><p>"At most half a month, I will break through to God King Seventh Heaven!"&nbsp;</p><p>When she thought of this, a smile appeared on her red lips.&nbsp;</p><p>If other people saw her like this, they would definitely be frightened!&nbsp;</p><p>They would probably think that this saintly daughter who was usually cold as ice, had some kind of problem somewhere.</p><p>A moment later, Ling Qianxue just got up and suddenly her expression changed. "Hmm?!" The chill surged from her body as she tightly stared at the void with fluctuations. This breath was very unfamiliar, and even made her heart palpitate. In Ling Qianxue's gaze, ripples appeared in the void and a strand of golden light emerged. "Buzz..." She stared at the space in front of her with a sense of great danger, ready to attack at any moment. Even the air around her froze under the shocking burst of cold air. But the next second... A vortex appeared in the void, and something resembling a book emerged! ãLing Qianxue's Diary Copy!ã There were even several shining words on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing this scene, Ling Qianxue was stunned and her delicate body trembled slightly. "This... is a diary copy? And my name is on it?" She didn't expect that the scary fluctuations she sensed would be something like this.&nbsp;</p><p>But just as she was very puzzled, the Diary Copy suddenly turned into a golden light and instantly entered Ling Qianxue's forehead, too fast for her to react. At that moment, Ling Qianxue's body trembled, her pupils contracted. "What is this!?" She breathed heavily, her expression changing. Then, a subtle feeling surged up in her heart, as if she had established a connection with something.ãLing Qianxue's Diary Copy!ããWith this diary copy, you can view the diary of the sole recorder, Su Changqing!ã&nbsp;</p><p>While Ling Qianxue was still stunned, two lines of information appeared in front of her, and the Diary Copy reappeared. "Su Changqing??? I can read his diary!?" Even as a Holy Maiden, she became restless.&nbsp;</p><p>Being able to read that guy's diary, what did he write in it!? For a moment, Ling Qianxue was filled with curiosity. But her pride stopped her from looking at it.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as she was lost in thought, the Diary Copy opened on its own. Then, a paragraph of text came into view. ãMy memory... has it finally returned?ã ãReborn? Back to ten thousand years ago?ã ãAs expected, the me in the future is a ruthless and failed person...ã As Ling Qianxue read the contents of the Diary Copy, her pupils suddenly shrank and her heartbeat accelerated. "What... what is this!? Su Changqing... that guy was reborn?" She couldn't believe what she was reading.</p><p>"Stormy waves!
That guy, he's been reborn?
Now, his memories have been restored? 
Keep reading below...
Ling Qianxue became even more shocked, her mind ringing with deafening roars! 
"The Boundary Sea? The Immortal Emperor of Darkness? What...what are these!?"
"A wave is a world? To the world they're in, the Nine Profound Skies are too small??"
"Lost? Who is Huang? Who is the ruthless person? What did Su Changqing face with them?!"
After reading the content in the diary, her inner shock was indescribable!
What did Su Changqing experience?
Why did she understand only a small portion of the words in the diary? 
What does 'lost' mean?
And is the content in the diary Su Changqing's future???
Especially since she was only reading the words, she could feel a great horror that seemed to come from the future, making her shiver all over!!

            <p>Chapter One: Spoiler Alert, Exposing the Problem of the Saintly Princess!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Su Yuwei was struck as if by lightning and stood still in place. "Wh... what!?" she exclaimed. "The Phoenix Mark? The Power of the Phoenix? He... he said..." She couldn't help but look at the bronze mirror next to her, her little hand lifting up to touch the crimson mark on her forehead. This... this was the Phoenix Mark!?&nbsp;</p><p>But why hadn't her father mentioned it to her? If the diary was fake and Su Changqing had never seen her before, how did he know about the mark on her forehead and speak of it so clearly!?&nbsp;</p><p>In an instant, Su Yuwei felt as if the world was spinning, her chest rising and falling with agitation. "I really became Su Changqing's Dao companion afterwards? And the mark he mentioned... is it really the Phoenix Mark!?" She didn't think about how to dig up dirt on Su Changqing and Ling Qianxue's relationship now, her heart was filled with shock and confusion.&nbsp;</p><p>If what Su Changqing said was true, then she...&nbsp;</p><p>"What a pity, Su Yuwei, this little loli, couldn't bear the incredible power of the Phoenix. Therefore, this power was sealed by the Emperor of the Great Feather Dynasty, and nobody is allowed to mention it. She has been searching for a solution to unlock this power." The diary continued, "If I remember correctly, Su Yuwei still doesn't know how powerful she will become after awakening and will only be informed by the Emperor in ten years' time! On that day, when Su Yuwei and I confided in each other and we got together, during our wedding day, many powerful experts in the Nine Profounds came and offered their congratulations. It's still a grand scene to think back on now."&nbsp;</p><p>"But this little loli is quite clingy after becoming my wife. She follows me wherever I go. Fortunately, Qianxue and Yuwei haven't been too hostile towards each other. Apart from the first time when they didn't see eye to eye, the rest of their days were sweet. It really makes me miss them." &nbsp;</p><p>"Now, this little loli probably thinks she has a weak physique and feeble body," the diary continued, "when in reality, it is because her Phoenix Power was sealed by the Emperor. To awaken the Phoenix Power, she just needs to find the Nirvana Pill, take it and she can awaken this power. After taking any other body-nourishing pills for a few days, she can go through the Phoenix Nirvana, which is to be reborn after being tempered by flames!"&nbsp;</p><p>After reading the updated content in the diary, Su Yuwei was even more surprised, her big, bright eyes widening further. "What!?! I... I confessed my feelings to Su Changqing of my own accord, and my father promised to marry me to him!?"&nbsp;</p><p>However, before she could speak, she saw the even more shocking content behind it! She had the Phoenix Power in her body! Due to being unable to bear it, her father had sealed it when she was born. This was why she had not yet awakened, and it was the root cause of her weak physique!? &nbsp;</p><p>What on earth was going on!?!</p><p>âIs this true!?â 
... 
[Except for Su Yuwei, this little loli, isn't Ling Qianxue also in a bad situation at this time?] 
[Currently, she's definitely stuck in her cultivation and can't figure out the specific reason. Although her cultivation was smooth in the past, if she continues to cultivate, she will inevitably be counterattacked by the coldness and fail!] 
[The biggest reason for this is that her technique is incomplete. Because of her own Ice Soul Holy Body, she can create her own techniques independently as she grows up. However, her current cultivation is incomplete, which makes it difficult for her to progress!] 
[Back then, Ling Qianxue was clueless, so her cultivation regressed. If she had known earlier that her technique was incomplete and needed to find the inconspicuous Xuan Yin Art on the third floor of the Scripture Pavilion to cultivate and reconcile the accumulated coldness in her body, she would have been able to break through to the Seventh Heaven of the Divine King much more smoothly!] 
[Now that she's reborn, she doesn't think about those things and just lives a good life...] 
[Now looking back, it's also unexpected that, after having Qianxue and Yuwei as fellow cultivators, I still have a third fellow cultivator!] 
[Mo Rong Dieyi, the witch of the Sunset Sea Demon Sect!] 
[Our relationship was quite wonderful, almost as if we wouldn't have met if not for fighting against each other at first, but then we somehow ended up together!] 
[Now that I think about it, that time was happy, and I haven't been to the Sunset Sea in thousands of years...] 
[Mo Rong Dieyi is currently the saintess of the demon sect, and even more so, the people of her own sect call her the witch. But in fact, she's not that scary. Only after deep contact can you clearly understand her character.] 
At this moment, on the Saintess Peak of Taiyi Sect, Ling Qianxue was intending to see what had happened to herself afterward, but she didn't expect to see the name of another person. 
"Su Yuwei? The princess of the Dayu Dynasty... She's also a fellow cultivator of Su Changqing!?" 
"I... I also serve the same master as her!?" 
"No, this can't be... Is this really me from the future!?" 
She looked at the contents of the journal, suddenly feeling dizzy. 
Especially when she saw Su Changqing mention that the Dayu princess had the Phoenix imprint and had the power of the Phoenix within her, she was even more shocked! 
Looking at it, Su Changqing didn't seem to be talking nonsense! 
The other party could clearly state the current problems with the Dayu princess's body and even provided such detailed solutions! 
Ling Qianxue couldn't help but feel confused, murmuring, "Is this... true?" 
"Both me and Su Yuwei are Su Changqing's fellow cultivators?" 
"Hmm!?" 
As she was lost in thought, she saw the diary mention herself again! 
Technique incomplete, will fail if cultivated again? 
The third floor of the Scripture Pavilion, Xuan Yin Art? 
... 
Was she the one that was being talked about here? 
How did Su Changqing know about her situation?</p><p>"Is it really possible that my cultivation can't advance any further? And this person even provided a solution?! Could it be that they've been secretly observing me? If not... there's only one possibility! Everything written in Su Changqing's diary is true!!"&nbsp;</p><p>Upon arriving at this realization, Ling Qianxue's thoughts became extremely tangled, and she didn't know how to sort them out. "I don't believe it," she eventually said, taking a deep breath and flooding her body with a chilling aura as she prepared to confirm the contents of the diary through her own cultivation.&nbsp;</p><p>After finding nothing unusual, she couldn't help but snort. "As expected, Su Changqing was just spouting nonsense in his diary." But in the next second, Ling Qianxue shuddered uncontrollably as her face turned ashen. "Pfft..." She felt an astonishing chill rushing towards her dantian, causing her to cough up a mouthful of icy, blood-covered spittle!&nbsp;</p><p>This... backlash from the chilling aura... how could it be possible?! Was it true that she had suffered a backlash just like Su Changqing had described?!&nbsp;</p><p>In an instant, Ling Qianxue's chest rose and fell rapidly, and her face turned pale. "Cangjing Pavilion... Xuan Yin Jue..." She immediately thought of what she had seen earlier and rushed towards the Cangjing Pavilion.&nbsp;</p><p>What Su Changqing had written in his diary was true... it was actually true!!!&nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>In other news, the author has published a new book and the old book, which spans two million words, has been completed with guaranteed quality! The author humbly requests everyone's support for the new book, whether it be in the form of flowers, evaluations, votes or comments. Please give the author some support, thank you all so much!!</p>

            <p>Chapter 4: The Princess and the Holy Woman, My Heart Aches for Gu Changqing!&nbsp;</p><p>In the grand Feather Dynasty, inside a room...&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since Su Yuwei followed Su Changqing's advice and took the Nirvana Pill, there has been a significant improvement in her health, with the mark on her forehead becoming more active.&nbsp;</p><p>"So, what Su Changqing revealed was true!" she mused to herself, curious to know what the future holds. Could it be possible that she and Su Changqing will truly fall in love?&nbsp;</p><p>At the thought, she felt her cheeks flush involuntarily.&nbsp;</p><p>And then...&nbsp;</p><p>"I've broken through to become a Saint again. But this time, my heart is incredibly calm... But what does being a Saint matter in the face of the coming chaos? We're no more than ants."&nbsp;</p><p>As she looked further down the replicated journal in front of her, her big eyes widened in shock.&nbsp;</p><p>A Saint was still small and powerless? And what's worse, what kind of horror lies ahead in the future?&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh my," she gasped as she read on, the pounding of her heart elevating. Even if Su Changqing and a handful of other celestial strongmen persevered to the end, they would eventually end up in failure.&nbsp;</p><p>"In this lifetime, I strive upwards. Forget the Saints, even emperors and supreme beings are defeated by the world sea. Sigh, never mind... Let's not think about it. Let this life simply be, calm down a bit. It's exhausting..." the journal continued.&nbsp;</p><p>As Su Yuwei read on, she felt a deep sense of powerlessness and her body grew increasingly tired.&nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing..." she murmured, unsure of why, feeling pangs of pain for him. As the son of the Daoist One Canon, his future is limitless, with achievements that are sure to surpass all. Yet, even he has moments of helplessness, becoming indifferent towards everything.&nbsp;</p><p>After a few moments of contemplation, Su Yuwei's eyes turned red and her little face was filled with sorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>"If I am to fall in love with Su Changqing, then... was I not able to help him?" She wondered about the future and the reason why they couldn't stay together. "Now that I have awakened the power of the divine phoenix within me, can I change the future?"</p><p>The Situation?&nbsp;</p><p>When Su Youwei snapped out of her daze, her face blushed like a ripe apple and she felt a wave of shame and embarrassment. After all, he was just a child! Besides, the Dark Turmoil was still far away, wasn't it?&nbsp;</p><p>...
Dao Yi Sect,
Sanctuary Maiden Peak.
Ling Qianxue's heart was restless for a long time.
"Consecutive breakthroughs, stepping into the realm of Saints with a single step..."
She murmured, and Su Changqing's figure kept popping up in her mind.
This man...is her future husband!
But why is it so hard for her to accept?
She feels lost and uncertain!
She has just broken through the seventh heaven of the God King, but the other party is already a Saint...
The disparity is too great!
"Buzz..."
Suddenly, the diary opened on its own!
Seeing this situation,
Ling Qianxue quickly collected her thoughts and stared straight at the diary that had opened on its own.
"This..."
When she saw the first line of text, she was stunned.
Breakthrough to Saint level, so calm?
This guy...
But as she continued to read, Ling Qianxue understood why Su Changqing was so calm, and felt a sense of shock at the same time!
"The Saint is just an ant when the Dark Turmoil arrives? Even the Immortals, the Supreme, and the Emperor are the same?"
"Su Changqing, he...he..."
She breathed quickly, her mind blank!
If she had been terrified by Su Changqing's revelations about the future before, she now understood how terrifying it really was!
All things are just ants...
What had Su Changqing experienced in his future life to be able to say such things after being reborn?!
After reading the diary, Ling Qianxue's expression was mixed, and she looked like she was in pain.
"Su Changqing, are you... tired?"
"Yes...despite resisting until the last moment, it was still a failure. It must be very tiring, right?"
She couldn't believe that even at the level of a Saint, Su Changqing couldn't be happy, and was instead unnaturally calm!
He didn't even want to struggle anymore, he just wanted to live a peaceful life forever.
But since Su Changqing is her future husband, how could she accept him being so hopeless?
Clamping her teeth, Ling Qianxue couldn't accept Su Changqing's declaration in the diary that he was going to give up like that!
"Su Changqing, pull yourself together!"
"Didn't you say that you would become a Taoist companion with me in the future? I...I will fight by your side!"
She thought about it, and her face turned red.</p><p>But this time, her gaze was extremely firm! Although she didn't know why she couldn't accompany Su Changqing to the end, since she knew in advance, she would definitely work hard to cultivate and strive to have the ability to participate in the war to quell the dark turmoil! Without any hesitation, Ling Qianshu stood up and left the room, about to go out! A maid came forward and asked, "Holy Maiden, what are you doing?" "I'm going to Saint Son Peak!" Ling Qianshu blurted out and then flew away! On site, a few maids were stunned and their minds went blank. What did they hear? Holy Maiden is going to Saint Son Peak? Before, the two had very little contact, right? Oh my god! The change in Holy Maiden these few days is too big! ...&nbsp;</p><p>On the other side, after Su Changqing wrote his diary, he just wanted to go out and explore the sect. "Will the story develop as I expected under my diary?" He muttered to himself. As a result, as soon as he went out, he saw a disciple waiting at the door. Seeing Su Changqing come out, the disciple hurriedly approached and respectfully said, "Disciple Chu Ming pays respect to Saint Son!" "Chu Ming?" Su Changqing was stunned when he heard the other party's words. Wait a minute! Isn't this a minor villain in the book? That's his follower! In the original text, although the boy in front of him was portrayed as brainless, his strength was among the best among many followers. And at this time, Chu Ming saw that Su Changqing didn't speak, and continued to say, "Saint Son, I... I want to leave the sect for a while! A letter came from home... My father is critically ill... I want to go home and see him!" After he finished speaking, he bowed deeply. Hearing this, Su Changqing's face showed a hint of doubt. He had never seen this plot in the original text. But before he could think too much, the voice of the system suddenly sounded in his mind... &nbsp;</p><p>P: The old author has published a new book, and will definitely work hard to update it frequently with guaranteed quality! The new book humbly requests everyone's data support! Flowers, ratings, and comments are all appreciated. Please give a little support to the author, thank you everyone! ...</p>

Was it because of him that the Jiuxuan Heaven fell apart and he joined the Daoist Saint Sect?". She felt a sense of exhaustion from Su Changqing at the end of the diary. Ling Qianxue wondered how much effort Su Changqing had exerted in that battle. She also realized that even if they didn't undergo rebirth, the battle of destruction would still come, a hundred years later. &nbsp;</p><p>Feeling a surge of anger inside, Ling Qianxue's eyes flickered with killing intent and her face showed a hint of displeasure. "Lin Fan? My senior brother doesn't want to deal with you, but... I can do it for him!" &nbsp;</p><p>"Do you still want to join the Daoist Saint Sect?" She spoke with a cold expression and a cold snort. Regardless of the situation, now that she knew the truth about the future, she couldn't allow such things to happen again! &nbsp;</p><p>"In a few days...isn't it the newbie assessment of Daoist Saint Sect? Ling Qianxue took a deep breath and tried to suppress her anger. "Fortunately, my senior brother mentioned the things that would happen in the future, or the battle of destruction would still occur!" &nbsp;</p><p>She gritted her teeth and made a decision. This time, she would take action for her senior brother and get rid of the trouble named Lin Fan in advance. &nbsp;</p><p>Three days later... &nbsp;</p><p>Outside the gate of Daoist Saint Sect, there were crowds of people. &nbsp;</p><p>And today, it was the assessment of the new disciples of Daoist Saint Sect! &nbsp;</p><p>If one wanted to become a real outer disciple of the Daoist Saint Sect, they had to go through a series of strict assessments! &nbsp;</p><p>However, due to the reputation of Daoist Saint Sect in Jiuxuan Heaven, countless people tried to become disciples of Daoist Saint Sect every year! &nbsp;</p><p>At the assessment of the third stage, the elder who was in charge of the assessment looked at a young man and nodded satisfactorily. &nbsp;</p><p>"Lin Fan, you passed the assessment!" &nbsp;</p><p>He had a wisp of appreciation in his eyes and announced it loudly. &nbsp;</p><p>Many people looked at Lin Fan with eyes full of envy. &nbsp;</p><p>Amidst many gazes, Lin Fan's mouth curled up in a smirk, revealing a sense of arrogance. &nbsp;</p><p>"It's really simple, after all, the assessment of Daoist Saint Sect is just like this." &nbsp;</p><p>He spoke arrogantly and looked disdainfully at the many assessors in the field. &nbsp;</p><p>With the help of the old man Yu, passing the assessment was straightforward! &nbsp;</p><p>As long as he entered Daoist Saint Sect, with such a Saint place for practice, he would definitely rise quickly! &nbsp;</p><p>As for the Holy Son? When the time comes, he would definitely make him his stepping stone! &nbsp;</p><p>Upon hearing Lin Fan's words, "This kid is really arrogant!" &nbsp;</p><p>"... " &nbsp;</p><p>All the people on the scene frowned but couldn't refute him. After all, he had passed three consecutive assessments with ease.</p><p>As Yuyan watched Lin Fan's smug expression, they felt a bit unhappy but had nothing to say. After all, strength was everything! This was an unchanging truth throughout the ages! However, just as Lin Fan was about to head to the next test location... "Holy Maiden!!" "What's going on? Why is the Holy Maiden here?" "This is the Holy Maiden of Dao Yi Sect? Truly a heavenly beauty, unparalleled in the world..." The scene immediately erupted into an uproar! A slender figure approached slowly, and it was none other than Ling Qianshuang. "Who is Lin Fan!?" She scanned the area with a cold expression and spoke indifferently. Finally, today had arrived and she was determined to eliminate the troublemaker that was mentioned in her senior brother's diary! Upon hearing this, "The Holy Maiden knows about Lin Fan too?" "I didn't expect that guy to catch the Holy Maiden's attention???" The expressions of everyone present were startled before they were filled with envy. Lin Fan, who was about to leave, was stunned for a moment before his eyes became bright! "This is the Holy Maiden of Dao Yi Sect!?" When he saw Ling Qianshuang, he looked dazed. She was so beautiful! Listening to the people around him, Lin Fan's heart raced, and he walked up with great excitement. "Greetings, Holy Maiden, I am Lin Fan!" He tried his best to restrain his inner joy. Indeed, gold shines wherever it goes! He had passed several tests and even attracted the attention of the Holy Maiden! Upon seeing Lin Fan in front of her, Ling Qianshuang's beautiful eyes flickered with killing intent and her body was filled with a chilling aura. "So it's you!!!!" Her expression revealed disgust as her cultivation as a Divine King broke out completely! In an instant, the color of the sky and earth changed! The surrounding temperature made people feel as if they were in an ice cave that had been frozen for thousands of years! "What's going on?!" Seeing such a change, everyone exclaimed and retreated! Even the elders who were conducting the assessment also immediately retreated to a safe distance! When a Divine King is angry, the scene is silent! Lin Fan, who had been daydreaming about his future in Dao Yi, suddenly changed his expression! "Holy Maiden, what...what do you mean!?" He felt the terrifying pressure and intense killing intent in Ling Qianshuang's eyes and shouted in surprise, spitting out a mouthful of blood. Wasn't the other person supposed to come to find him? Instead, they wanted to kill him??! ... P.S.: The author has released a new book, and will definitely work hard to update it frequently with guaranteed quality! The new book humbly requests everyone's support! Flower ratings, votes and comments are all welcome, please give the author some support, everyone!</p>

            <p>Chapter 4: If You Want It, My Life Can Be Yours!&nbsp;</p><p>Dao Yi Holy Sect,
Saintess Peak.&nbsp;</p><p>As Su Changqing left, Ling Qianxue was feeling somewhat lost. She had no interest in practicing. "Senior Brother..." She kept recalling the diary entries she had read before, and was now constantly flipping through the diary copy.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, she had been through so much! How much suffering had she endured? How many hardships had she experienced? What kind of world awaited her in the future?&nbsp;</p><p>At many moments, she really wanted to confide in her senior brother and ask about the future. However, she ultimately lacked the courage to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, the diary copy shone brightly and automatically flipped to the latest page. "Witch? Why is she here?" As soon as she saw the first line, Ling Qianxue's previous thoughts vanished, and she stared intently at the contents of the diary.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Witch? You mean Murong Dieyi?" She gritted her teeth and continued reading. Senior Brother wanted to see her so much, and missed her the most? This... She had read this section before, but had no particular feeling at the time. However, upon seeing it again, Ling Qianxue felt uncomfortable and restless.&nbsp;</p><p>"Hasn't the Demon Sect not participated in the Southern Domain's grand event for hundreds of years? Why did they go now?" she wondered. "Could it be that Murong Dieyi heard about Senior Brother's deeds and rushed over to see him?!" The more she thought about it, the more she clenched her fists in anger.&nbsp;</p><p>Damn it, damn it! She should have gone along too! After finishing the diary, Ling Qianxue couldn't calm down. Her heart was even more restless.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why is Senior Brother so good to her? Am I... not worthy?" She began to think randomly for the first time, biting her lip tightly. However, upon careful consideration, she realized that she had not yet become Senior Brother's woman.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, she couldn't help feeling jealous, her nose tingling from anger.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Great Feather Dynasty, Su Youwei had finished reading Su Changqing's updated diary, hands on her hips, looking quite adorable.&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, that witch Murong Dieyi actually went to the grand event?" "Humph, humph... Su Changqing, you stinky man, you're such a flirt!" She pouted, grumbling away.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at it some more, she eventually stopped looking altogether, feeling like she had been sidelined. Was she... jealous?&nbsp;</p><p>"Ew, ew, ew..." Su Youwei stamped her foot, unable to resist the temptation to read the diary again.</p><p>Su Changqing wants to protect her? Does he not want to protect me too? She grumbled, glaring fiercely with her bright big eyes. No way! Ling Qianxue and Murong Dieyi have both met Su Changqing, she must find a chance to see him too. Otherwise, he might forget about her entirely! With a determined mind, Su Yuwei murmured to herself, "What kind of guy is he exactly?" She propped her chin on the table, her eyes filled with curiosity. At the Grand Ceremony Palace, Murong Dieyi, who was walking towards Su Changqing, was stunned as she looked at the diary replica that appeared before her. "The person I most want to see and miss, Dieyi, is now standing before me!" "Long time no see, Dieyi..." Her heart trembled as she read the content of the diary. Looking at Su Changqing, who was already right in front of her, she no longer displayed the cold arrogance she had as a witch in the Demonic Sect. Her heart was beating faster, and her face felt hot as she read these words. Especially after reading the contents of the diary, Murong Dieyi's heart was beating like a startled deer, wondering if she would really fall in love with this man in front of her? "Why am I feeling this way..." She looked into Su Changqing's deep eyes, her heart beating even faster. The worldly weariness and tenderness in his eyes did not seem like an act! Just as she could not control her emotions, Murong Dieyi quickly stopped thinking and looked at Su Changqing calmly. "I am Murong Dieyi of the Demonic Sect, and I have come to attend the Grand Ceremony on behalf of my sect. I have heard that you single-handedly swept the top five of the original Heavenly Arrogance List, and it seems that your reputation is well-deserved. I wonder if we can sit down and discuss our knowledge?" Speaking calmly, she instantly intrigued the disciples of the Demonic Sect. Su Changqing, on the other hand, looked at Murong Dieyi's calm expression and couldn't help but smile. "She's quite good at playing it cool..." he muttered to himself, but his eyes filled with tenderness. "I'm more than happy to do so." In response to Su Changqing's answer, Murong Dieyi looked slightly startled. She squinted her eyes and teasingly asked, "Aren't you afraid...that I might suddenly attack you?" "I'm not afraid. If you want my life, I can give it to you anytime." Su Changqing's eyes were deep, with more worldly weariness evident on his face. He leaned slightly closer to Murong Dieyi's ear.</p><p>Bian spoke softly. At this moment, Murong Dieyi was stunned and her body trembled slightly. "You...you..." She felt the warmth of his breath and his words, and quickly took a few steps back. Looking at Su Changqing, who revealed a look of vicissitudes before her, Murong Dieyi's face blushed, revealing a hint of shyness. This guy... Seeing Su Changqing's sincere expression, Murong Dieyi's breathing became quicker and her heart was deeply touched. "Would you even give your life for me..." She recalled Su Changqing's words and her chest heaved. As other people saw Su Changqing and the witch appear to have a somewhat ambiguous exchange, they all widened their eyes. "???" "What's going on between them??" There were murmurs and whispering around them, with curious glances cast towards the two. As for Su Changqing, seeing Murong Dieyi's attempt to conceal her reaction, he lifted the corner of his mouth slightly. "Miss, I still don't know why you're here? I can't control you yet." He muttered in his heart, while his face was full of gentleness. Suddenly... [Ding!] [System is detecting...detection complete...] [Name: Xi Ya!] [Identity: disciple of the demon sect!] [Encounter: suffered a setback in seeking a breakthrough three days ago, if not handled in time, will leave problems for later!] [Note: This person has good aptitude and will achieve great success in the future. The host can consider investing!] The voice of the system suddenly came to his mind. Upon hearing the prompt, Su Changqing immediately looked towards a demon sect disciple behind Murong Dieyi. "Here are five Tianlu Gathering Spirit Pills. After taking them, your current condition can be eliminated. In the future, you must not be too impatient when cultivating." He waved his hand, and the pill bottle slowly floated towards the demon sect girl named Xi Ya. ... P.S.

            <ns0:content type="html">
            <p>Chapter 1: Xia Qingxuan, my comrade-in-arms, let's fight together!&nbsp;</p><p>
At this moment, the person who had been reading up to the latest entry on Xia Qingxuan's diary saw the updated content written by Su Changqing.&nbsp;</p><p>"What...?" She shuddered all over when she read Su Changqing's words. What did he mean?&nbsp;</p><p>"Does she know that I lost her in my previous life and that I owe her so much?" "In this life, I remember her, but she doesn't remember me..."&nbsp;</p><p>After reading this section of the updated content, Xia Qingxuan was completely at a loss. "Su Changqing... do we know each other?" "Is he talking about our future?!" "What is our relationship?!"&nbsp;</p><p>Her chest heaved and her mind went blank. What did Su Changqing mean in his diary? The relationship between them in the future seemed anything but simple... At this moment, Xia Qingxuan's heart was beating uncontrollably as she frantically searched for Su Changqing's whereabouts.&nbsp;</p><p>"Is that him? Su Changqing, the son of the Dao Yi Sanctum?"&nbsp;</p><p>After looking around for a week, she saw a handsome scholar who was looking straight at her. His eyes were deep, and there was even a touch of tenderness in them!&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing this, Xia Qingxuan couldn't help but hold her breath, feeling more and more shaken. "He... he really is a reborn person..."&nbsp;</p><p>"But, is there anything unusual between us in the future?!" Her heart was pounding as she thought of the diary content she had seen before. In the future, there would be many things happening between her and Su Changqing, and she already knew of three people who were related to him, and each of them had an extraordinary identity. But what about her?...&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, Xia Qingxuan did not dare to go and see Su Changqing anymore, but she was filled with doubts. "How could something like this happen to me?" She still felt it was all so unreal.&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing would recognize her in the future! Now that he had been reborn and his memory restored, he seemed to feel indebted to her after seeing her again. What exactly happened between her and Su Changqing?...&nbsp;</p><p>On the other side, Murong Dieyi noticed that Su Changqing was still looking at Xia Qingxuan from the North Ming Holy Land, and his expression was somewhat dim.&nbsp;</p><p>"Do they have an unusual relationship too?" She naturally read through the diary's updated content and had a feeling of discomfort in her heart. It was almost like... Su Changqing belonged to her, but a part of him was taken away by someone else.</p><p>At the moment, her heart was complicated. She couldn't even say for sure what kind of emotions she was feeling. However, Su Changqing was completely focused on Xia Qingxuan on the other side, continuing to write in his diary. &nbsp;</p><p>"Qingxuan, my comrade, my wife... I didn't expect us to meet again in this life," he wrote. "I remember that in my previous life, we first met after the Battle of Collapse. Even though I was exhausted after the war, you were also injured. After that, we didn't meet until the War of the Heavenly Realms came."&nbsp;</p><p>"By then, we were no longer in competition with each other. The major holy sites, the Divine Dynasty, and other forces had already formed an alliance to face the war together! It's a coincidence, but the Dao One Saint Sect and the North Ming Sacred Land entrusted their backs to each other. At that time, we became comrades-in-arms fighting together!"&nbsp;</p><p>"After thirty years of fighting in the War of the Heavenly Realms, we finally got together! You even told me that if the war couldn't be ended, we would fight until the last minute of our lives and never be separated!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Thus, we fought side by side for 200 years, experiencing hardships and difficulties together, resisting the attacks of forces from Heavenly Realms again and again!"&nbsp;</p><p>"I thought the War of the Heavenly Realms was finally going to end, and we could live a peaceful life. But the biggest variable appeared in that war! The Nine Profound Heavenly Realm became the target of various forces and was surrounded and attacked."&nbsp;</p><p>"In the face of the encirclement and suppression by multiple forces, the Nine Profound Heavenly Realm and other major holy sites, the Divine Dynasty, and other forces took a desperate gamble and fought to the death!"&nbsp;</p><p>"But ultimately, the minority was no match for the majority...In that battle, Nine Profound Heavenly Realm collapsed, and countless forces were wiped out during resistance. I was unable to turn the tide and fought to exhaustion!"&nbsp;</p><p>"You, on the other hand... For the sake of letting me live, you separated my breath while I was severely injured and used your soul to teleport me away!"&nbsp;</p><p>"I could only watch as you risked everything, until you fell in the end..."&nbsp;</p><p>"In the end, I couldn't even give you a grand wedding and fulfill our promise. It's forever stuck in the war of the Heavenly Realms. I don't remember what happened after that, it seems like I've been sleeping for a long time...."&nbsp;</p><p>"Now that I'm reborn and seeing you again, I have so much I want to say to you, but I can't recognize you."&nbsp;</p><p>"Looking back, in my past life, I lived too tiredly."&nbsp;</p><p>"In this life... if possible, I want to make up for everything I owe you and fulfill our promise."  &nbsp;</p><p>After reading the updated diary, Murong Dieyi's expression was shocked as she looked at Su Changqing in front of her.&nbsp;</p><p>"Comrade? Wife?" she gasped, taking a deep breath and continuing to read.</p><p>Su Changqing and Xia Qingxuan had their first encounter, and later on, their second meeting led to them becoming comrades in battle and eventually lovers. After reading the latest updates, Murong Dieyi's heart was pounding as she turned to look at Xia Qingxuan in the Northern Ming Sanctuary. She was shaken by this person's deep gratitude towards Su Changqing. Before Xia Qingxuan, Ling Qianxue had also sacrificed herself to save Su Changqing during the dark turmoil. In that moment, Murong Dieyi's eyes grew serious and she felt a strong sense of danger in her heart. "Then...what is my position in Su Changqing's heart?" she wondered, her thoughts becoming anxious. If she and Su Changqing were really together, could she compete with the other women he had feelings for? 
Meanwhile, Xia Qingxuan was also surprised to see Su Changqing's diary updates. The first line alone left her stunned. "What?! My future is to be Su Changqing's comrade in battle and his wife?!" She couldn't believe it. Was this really her future? Were all of these things true? With more doubts in her heart, she continued reading his diary updates.
Last but not least, the author announced the release of a new book and promises to work hard to update frequently with quality content. They also humbly ask for the readers' support in the form of flowers, ratings, and comments. And finally, the text ends with a teaser for the next chapter, prompting readers to click and continue reading.</p>

            <p>Chapter 4: I know you like the back of my hand, let's fight side by side! &nbsp;</p><p>Amidst the gaze of countless onlookers, Su Changqing shook his head helplessly, before slowly rising into the air and landing on the Dao Platform. &nbsp;</p><p>"You go first," he said in a gentle tone, with a hint of indulgence in his gaze.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon seeing this, Xia Yilin frowned. Why did it feel like he was being looked at like a child by his dad?&nbsp;</p><p>"Phew, phew, phew!" He quickly shook his head, as an astonishing aura burst forth from his body. "Don't underestimate me. In this battle, I will surely take your place as sixth on the Heavenly Genius List, and pave my own invincible path!"&nbsp;</p><p>With that, he ascended into the air and wielded a shining and fairy-like long spear, which emitted an aura of destruction.&nbsp;</p><p>In an instant, a gust of violent winds and thunder roared through the venue, as countless people gasped in shock. A senior continued to cry out, "Thunderbolt Meteor Exterminating Immortal Spear! Back in the day... when the North Sea Holy Master relied on this immortal weapon, he stood undefeated at the Heavenly Platform, roamed the world, and countless Heavenly Platform experts died under this spear!"&nbsp;</p><p>"No wonder!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh my god, then... isn't Su Changqing certain to lose?!" &nbsp;</p><p>Countless people turned pale upon hearing this, recalling the legendary story of the North Sea Master in Central State, and couldn't help but exclaim in shock.&nbsp;</p><p>And at this very moment, accompanied by the appearance of the Thunderbolt Meteor Exterminating Immortal Spear, the sky exploded and a million thunders roared. With the terrifying pressure emanating from the immortal spear, most people turned pale and trembled.&nbsp;</p><p>Especially with Xia Yilin's infusion of spiritual energy, the Thunderbolt Meteor Exterminating Immortal Spear hummed and crackled with lightning, unleashing destructive power towards the surroundings.&nbsp;</p><p>However, upon seeing this scene, Su Changqing's eyes flickered slightly, but his expression remained as calm as ever.&nbsp;</p><p>"Still the same." He chuckled while placing his hands behind him.&nbsp;</p><p>Xia Yilin felt puzzled, but didn't think too much about it as he exerted all his strength.&nbsp;</p><p>"Boom!!!" &nbsp;</p><p>As he nailed down his spear, the void exploded, and the temple shook. The dazzling lightning was so bright that it made one's eyes hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>But the sound of thunder shook the surroundings, and all the people on the scene were frightened.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after a moment, when they opened their eyes and saw the situation on the platform, everyone's eyes widened in disbelief.&nbsp;</p><p>"???!" &nbsp;</p><p>They sucked in a breath of cold air, and the whole place fell silent.&nbsp;</p><p>They saw that Su Changqing stood unscathed on the tip of the Thunderbolt Meteor Exterminating Immortal Spear, with his white robe fluttering in the howling wind.&nbsp;</p><p>Xia Yilin blinked his eyes and looked at Su Changqing with an incredulous expression.&nbsp;</p><p>"You..." He gritted his teeth and raised his hand, ready for another attack.</p><p>Challenge!
However,
Su Changqing just calmly landed with a slight step.
But,
Xia Yilin became even more frustrated, urging the Thunderbolt Meteor Immortal Spear in his hand to attack again!
"Dodge, I'll make you dodge!!!!"
He shouted loudly, waving the Thunderbolt Meteor Immortal Spear and once again condensing a destructive attack!
Boom! Boom! Boom!!!
The terrifying roar was incessant, and the huge sacred palace was instantly covered with endless thunderbolts, turning into thunderbolts!
Every attack that landed caused the sacred palace to shudder under the skin of a sage, and the heart rate jumped wildly!
It was too overbearing!!!
Especially the shocking destructive aura made the majority of people's faces turn pale, fearing that they would be affected!
Under Xia Yilin's overwhelming attack that almost tore the entire sacred palace apart,
Su Changqing did not make a move, even easily avoiding the attacks that made all the Saint-level cultivators' faces change.
But at this moment,
Xia Qingxuan gradually widened her eyes and took a cold breath.
"Su Changqing...he..."
Her body trembled slightly, and she suddenly felt dry in her mouth and tongue.
Under her younger brother's domineering attack, the other party was actually walking leisurely, completely avoiding and resolving it!
Su Changqing seemed to be familiar with all of Xia Yilin's moves, as if he knew everything, it showed a sense of being carefree in the face of the storm.
But...
Haven't they met before???
After a moment,
Xia Qingxuan's chest rose and fell, staring at Su Changqing's figure firmly.
"How could this be?!"
She is now sure that this is not a coincidence!!!
But Su Changqing really does know the moves her younger brother is going to use, and also knows how to resolve them!
Not only Xia Qingxuan,
Everyone present saw that Su Changqing had no intention of making a move, and also had control over all of Xia Yilin's moves!
"Whoa!!!"
Instantly, an astonishing commotion broke out on the scene!
On the crumbling platform,
Xia Yilin became more and more anxious, he was almost dumbfounded!
"???"
He looked at Su Changqing, who was still intact, and countless thoughts flooded his mind.
What's going on???
This guy actually avoided all of his attacks.
Even...
The starry sky trapping immortal spear technique, which only his father can use in the entire Nine Xuan Heaven, was also completely resolved!
What the hell is going on???
Panic, completely panic!
Just as Xia Yilin regained his senses and was about to take action again...
Su Changqing smiled slightly and said calmly, "That's enough."</p><p>As if a thunderbolt that could destroy everything was piercing through, he swiftly moved and appeared behind Xia Yilin, striking him with a palm. 
Immediately after that, Xia Yilin widened his eyes and flew out like a kite with a broken string. 
"Boom! Boom! Boom..." 
He felt an intense pain in his back and tumbled on the field for dozens of rounds before stopping. 
His teeth gritted in pain. 
How could this happen? Was it because Su Changqing did not want to hurt himself earlier that he did not make a move? 
Damn it... he lost just like that when Su Changqing only made a slight move? 
It was embarrassing and a huge blow to his invincibility. How was he supposed to continue his undefeated path? 
Even if he was unwilling, he knew that he was no match for Su Changqing now. It was better to crawl into a hole than to be beaten in front of so many people. 
At this moment, Xia Yilin suddenly screamed and coughed up blood before falling to the ground. 
Not only were other people confused, but Xia Qingxuan also couldn't help but cover her forehead. 
Su Changqing walked to Xia Yilin's side, shook his head, and laughed, "You are so fake, stop pretending." 
"Get up, Iron Egg." 
Xia Yilin who originally thought he could fool others with his act twitched at his words. 
"Huh?! How do you know my nickname?" 
But when he heard Su Changqing's title behind him, he stood up in shock, his face full of disbelief! 
This was the nickname given to him by his father when he was mischievous and stubborn as a child. 
But how did a non-Daoyi Holy Son know about it!? 
Su Changqing looked at the bewildered Xia Yilin and his face revealed a sense of fondness as he softly said, "Iron Egg, you don't know yet..." 
"We... fought for our lives in the Battle of the Heavens, shed blood together." 
"At that time, no matter how many enemies there were, every battle was a fight to the death, repelling the enemies of the heavens time and time again with our attacks." 
...

His power is definitely beyond what we have seen. Maybe he could even take second place if he wanted to!" &nbsp;</p><p>"Perhaps only Daozi can rival him!" &nbsp;</p><p>When Daozi was mentioned, all the disciples of the Dao Palace looked fanatical. &nbsp;</p><p>For them, no matter how strong Su Changqing may be, he could never be a match for Daozi. &nbsp;</p><p>On the highest peak of the entire Dao Palace, Daozi Wang Ye was also looking at the Heavenly Pride List, specifically at the third position. &nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing..." &nbsp;</p><p>He murmured, his eyes growing increasingly serious. &nbsp;</p><p>It can be said that he was finally interested in someone on the Heavenly Pride List! &nbsp;</p><p>Ranked sixth before, he was able to suppress the top five on the list alone. Now, he easily overpowered and killed the fourth-ranked Xiang Yuan. &nbsp;</p><p>Afterwards, Su Changqing did not replace whoever he defeated like others would. Instead, he even pushed the original third rank down! &nbsp;</p><p>Wang Ye still stared at Su Changqing's name, his expression growing more and more serious. &nbsp;</p><p>"I'm afraid this person's strength can easily replace second place?" &nbsp;</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Wang Ye smiled lightly, his eyes filled with confidence. &nbsp;</p><p>"No matter how strong you are, when facing me, you have no chance of winning!" &nbsp;</p><p>He spoke as if he was talking to Su Changqing, but also like he was talking to himself. &nbsp;</p><p>Since his rebirth, he had already restored most of his memories. Now, he has the perfect opportunity to take part in the big competition of the world. &nbsp;</p><p>Thinking of this, Wang Ye looked up at the sky, squinting his eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>"In this life, there will be no one who can stop me!" &nbsp;</p><p>As he spoke, his figure became ethereal. &nbsp;</p><p>Leaving behind only a low whisper, he soon disappeared without a trace. &nbsp;</p><p>While causing a big stir outside, at this moment, in the celebration inside, everyone stared at the Heavenly Pride List on the canopy, their faces pale. &nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing... he's not fourth, but third now!?" &nbsp;</p><p>"Has his strength already surpassed the fourth?"</p><p>As a Chinese to English translator and editor, my translation of the text is as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>"Wait...wait...Su Changqing was overwhelmingly dominant in his battle with Xiang Yuan before, even in the face of the supreme pressure. He remained calm and composed, suggesting that his strength may have not reached its maximum potential!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"No way?! Does this mean that Su Changqing has a chance to compete for the top spot on the Heavenly Proud Ranking?!"&nbsp;</p><p>"It's unbelievable! I canât wait to see Su Changqing's next fight. He's too strong!"&nbsp;</p><p>"What I'm even more concerned about is whether the Dao Saint Sect will really go to war with the Undead Demon Clan.

            <ns0:content type="html">
            <p>Chapter 1: Is he sixth? This is clearly more terrifying than the first!
Now, outside the Holy Land, it is in ruins!
Almost everyone is unable to maintain a standing posture!
Even the top five on the list, such as Jiuyou, Wang Teng, and Sima Chen, are now extremely embarrassed, and their bodies are trembling uncontrollably!
Their minds were blank, and they stared dumbfoundedly in the direction of the Saint Peak.
Seeing this scene outside,
Not a single disciple of the Daoist Holy Sect is not dry-mouthed, struggling to swallow their saliva!
"Just the Saint alone is enough to suppress them five!?"
"These are the top five when the Heavenly Pride List was just released???"
"Yes, they are, but... our Saint's strength far exceeds theirs!"
"My God, just a single attack caused these guys to lose their combat ability!?"
"What is the Saint's true strength? Otherwise, with just the Triple Realm of Saint, can he really suppress the top five of the original Heavenly Pride List!?"
Everyone was extremely shocked, and the waves of shock in their hearts were beyond words.
To have such means, the Saint is only ranked sixth!?
Among the crowd,
Ling Qianxue looked dazedly at the ruins outside the Holy Land.
"Senior Brother... Senior Brother he..."
She breathed rapidly, her chest rising and falling!
She thought her senior brother exaggerated a bit in his diary, but now it seems...
He didn't exaggerate at all, but rather was too modest!
These five original top-ranking people may be very strong to others, but to Senior Brother...
It's really just a vain name!!!
The reason why he is ranked sixth is just because he doesn't want to compete...
If he really wanted to compete for the top spot, could Senior Brother not also suppress the current first on the Heavenly Pride List!?
The more she thought about it, the more shocked Ling Qianxue became, and the greater the fluctuations in her chest became.
"With Senior Brother's strength, he should be able to do it, right!?"
She muttered silently in her heart, still not coming back to reality!
Because of the previous attack, she could also feel the Supreme breath that made souls tremble!
That was something that neither she nor Sima Chen and others could contend with, and they didn't even qualify!!!
After a moment,
Whether it was Wang Teng or Jiuyou, or the original first Sima Chen, they had all regained their composure!
"Su Changqing... is he... is he sure he's sixth???"
"Why do I feel like he's as terrifying as those top five on the list now!?"
"No... Su Changqing... Su Changqing is at least scarier than the guy who replaced me in my position!!!"
As Jiuyou spoke, his body trembled!
Thinking back to almost dying at Su Changqing's hands before, he struggled to swallow his saliva!
Before, he faced the challenge and successfully made it onto the list.</p><p>The third person was far from as weak as facing Su Changqing, at least there was still some room to maneuver. But... when Su Changqing made his move, he didn't even have the qualifications to resist!!! The group looked at each other, their pupils contracting! "Why didn't he use this kind of strength to fight for first place instead of being content with sixth place?" "This guy... is pretending to be weak to catch the strong off guard?" "Sima Chen, didn't you say that Su Changqing was left to you before? I won't stay then..." Wang Teng looked at the Saintly Peak with fear, feeling ashamed. Without much delay, he turned around and hurriedly led the people from the Hidden Dragon Temple away! As for Jiuyou, he didn't plan to continue losing face. "Let's go!" He took a deep breath, and his legs were a little weak! Su Changqing was too terrifying!!! In no time, the people who came before had already run away, not daring to linger for even a moment! They were afraid of offending Su Changqing and being wiped out! Even Sima Chen, who was always proud and the son of the Tianyan Divine Palace, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and fled! "Damn it!!!" He turned his head and glanced in fear at Saintly Peak. What kind of monster was Su Changqing?! Since he had such terrifying strength, why was he ranked sixth on the Heavenly Envy List?! Wasn't this purely deceiving people?! In this battle today... I'm afraid I will become a laughingstock and infamous! Meanwhile, at the Saintly Peak, Su Changqing looked at the empty space outside the holy land and shook his head. "They insist on courting death, I can't scare them..." He muttered to himself and then laughed. Their strength was simply not worth mentioning in his presence. As for Ling Qianxue, she should trust herself more now, right? Previously, he had unlocked extreme trust and the upper limit of trust points. It was only a matter of time before he conquered the Saintess. However, he didn't know when Su Yuwei and Murong Dieyi would reach the limit of trust points and unlock extreme trust. Who would be unlocked next? He shook his head. Su Changqing didn't dwell on these questions, but planned to continue forging the diary. "It's really boring. Can this be considered a battle?" "If you have the energy to mess around, why not focus on improving yourself and shining in the future?" "In my previous life, I fought against people and against the heavens, only to find out how weak and powerless I was during the Dark Turmoil. If I had devoted myself to cultivation, disregarded fame, and kept what I had, perhaps I would have reached the peak of the turbulent times in 300 years.â</p><p>"In the Battle of the Multiverse, one will not face the enemy alone for thousands of years, nor will the flesh be destroyed, the soul will almost fall and struggle for a glimmer of hope in the Sea of Soul Reapers, nor will it kill until the end of the Battle of the Multiverse, and then it will be discovered that there is no one else around. If there are stages of loneliness, I should have experienced the ninth level. Endless loneliness, only endless killing can make me forget regrets and forget myself. It's all in the past now. With the chance to be reborn, I should also forget... With the updates of Su Changqing's diary, Ling Qianshuang, who was originally returning to the Holy Maiden Peak, paused when she saw the diary copy that had been opened automatically in front of her. "Senior Brother!?" She looked at the first line of font that appeared slowly in front of her and took a deep breath. Was it just some mischief? It's no wonder he's her senior brother! But as she continued reading... Ling Qianshuang suddenly held her breath and her pupils contracted! "Three hundred years later, the Battle of the Multiverse!?". She now clearly remembers that the emergence of the Little Fairy Terrace Tianjiao List was the beginning of the chaotic era! However, three hundred years later, the Battle of the Multiverse will erupt?! Then as she continued reading, Ling Qianshuang's expression changed and her delicate body began to tremble! "Senior Brother...You... You alone endured so much in the future..." She looked at the text above, and scenes of dangerous images involuntarily flashed in her mind! Her senior brother experienced various dangers, enduring loneliness for thousands of years... After finishing reading the diary, Ling Qianshuang's eyes were already reddish, and she tightly clenched her fists. "Senior Brother, in this life... I will always be by your side!!" Her breathing was disordered, and she looked towards the direction of the Holy Son Peak with great concern. She must become stronger! She can't let Senior Brother face everything alone and be lonely!...&nbsp;</p><p>P.S. The author has released a new book and will definitely update it diligently with guaranteed quality.

            <p>The Chapter: Will Universe be Destroyed by the Invasion of the Boundless Sea in the Future?&nbsp;</p><p>Before the diary copy,&nbsp;</p><p>"The shattered multiverse, the extinction of all beings..."&nbsp;</p><p>"And that Immortal Emperor hidden in the darkness... What are these... What is all of this!?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Is this Su Changqing's future? What kind of horror did he experience!?"&nbsp;</p><p>Ling Qianxue looked at the content in the diary and felt a chill down her spine!&nbsp;</p><p>From these words, she could feel Su Changqing's sadness and deep helplessness!&nbsp;</p><p>What is it exactly???&nbsp;</p><p>Now she couldn't calm down, her heart raging like the waves...&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time,&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing's diary had new content again!&nbsp;</p><p>"An upheaval of darkness...blood and fire throughout all the multiverses...a first-level warning signal was raised, and all living things were truly affected!"&nbsp;</p><p>"All the major Dark Supremes mobilized, and all creatures cried while plunging into the deepest darkness..."&nbsp;</p><p>"That battle crushed the heavens and shattered the earth. The void collapsed, and everything was destroyed. Even though I and Huang, Henren, and Ye Tian Emperor tried our best, we still couldn't quell this terrifying upheaval of darkness!"&nbsp;</p><p>"These guys chose to slaughter everything and annihilate all life for the sake of immortality. Wherever they went, all lives were extinguished. They have gone mad!"&nbsp;</p><p>"In that battle, many heroes emerged to resist the ancient Dark Supremes but ended up falling one by one, unable to survive the carnage."&nbsp;</p><p>"There was also the invasion of the Boundless Sea. The curse and misfortune mentioned repeatedly originated from the other side of the Boundless Sea, which is too mysterious and divine-like."&nbsp;</p><p>"I never expected... that there was a source of darkness on the other side of the Boundless Sea. Can becoming an Immortal Emperor come from a fall? Ha...Those guys have no emotions and are like machines. What use is this kind of Immortal Emperor?"&nbsp;</p><p>"A wave is already a world. It's too big, too big. Jiuxuan Heaven cannot compare with it at all!"&nbsp;</p><p>"It's a pity... and it's hateful..."&nbsp;</p><p>"In that battle, many of our loved ones died. They all died...the descendants we protected perished!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Even if we burned the essence of our souls, combined the future, past, and present into one, it was still useless..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Even though the major imperial soldiers awakened, they still ended up being blown to bits!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Regretful? Regretful, but also unwilling!"&nbsp;</p><p>"We left with regret. The world called us the dawn of all races but we failed to quell the chaos. It's so regretful...with all creatures weeping, we lost, bleeding out until the very end..."&nbsp;</p><p>"So tired, really...so difficult!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Huang, Henren, Ye Tian Emperor, Wu Shi...aren't you all filled with regret like me?"&nbsp;</p><p>When Ling Qianxue saw that the diary was being updated, she stood there...</p><p>Ma gathered her thoughts and focused on the diary entry. "Dark turmoil!? Invasion of the sea boundaries?!" She was stunned at the first sentence and felt a wave of anxiety wash over her. What kind of terror was this? As she continued reading, Ling Qianxue's body shook even more, and her face turned pale. "The origin of darkness...what is this?!" She couldn't calm her inner turmoil and her body trembled uncontrollably. &nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqingâs diary foretold future events!? Would even Jiu xuan heaven be involved? And regarding the savages, Ye Tian emperor mentioned in the diary...they were the dawn of all ethnic groups!? &nbsp;</p><p>But despite this, they were still unable to quell the dark turmoil and failed!? Was this what the future held? Why...why was it like this!? As she reached the end, Ling Qianxue was completely shocked, her expression vacant. "Regret..." She stared at the final words of the diary, her breath quickening. Su Changqing...had this kind of identity?! He had participated in the horrific battle to quell the dark turmoil, but still couldn't avoid the destruction of countless lives, earth and sky collapsing, and a bloodbath of all living beings in the universe...&nbsp;</p><p>That guy who usually seemed uninteresting turned out to have this unknown side! Su Changqing...had been reborn! And she had accidentally obtained a copy of his diary, seeing the events that would soon take place? Dark turmoil, invasion of the sea boundaries...all ethnic groups bathed in blood, ultimately ending in failure!? Her mind was ringing with deafening roars. Even if she was just reading the words in the diary, she could imagine how terrible it must have been at that time! "Why...why is it like this!?" Her face was white as she felt the endless horror and regret in Su Changqing's diary.&nbsp;</p><p>The future would bring such terrible things!? At this moment...Ling Qianxue was shaken! Su Changqing had been reborn, regained his memory, and revealed the fateful events that were to come! All she could think about was the contents of the diary, and even breathing became difficult for her. Meanwhile, in the Great Feather Dynasty, in a room full of girlish charm, a small loli with a phoenix mark on her forehead...</p><p>With wide open bright eyes, Su Yowei looked in awe at the copy of her diary in front of her.&nbsp;</p><p>"This...this is my diary copy?!" she exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>"The only recorder of the diary...Su Changqing??" &nbsp;</p><p>"This guy is not the son of Dao One Holy Sect? I can read the diary he wrote?!"&nbsp;</p><p>The surprise on her lovely face was evident, she was obviously shocked!&nbsp;</p><p>The little girl was the princess of the Da Yu Dynasty, Su Yowei!&nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>The text appears to be cut off with an incomplete hyperlink attached at the end. However, based on the provided text, it seems that Su Yowei is surprised to find a copy of her diary written by Su Changqing, who is possibly the son of the Dao One Holy Sect. The text mentions that Su Yowei is the princess of Da Yu Dynasty and describes her expression of surprise.</p>

            <p>Chapter One: The Woman Who Worries Me, Murong Dieyi!&nbsp;</p><p>After learning the truth, Su Yuwei was shocked to hear that it was exactly what Su Changqing had told her.&nbsp;</p><p>"Dad, can't we solve it now?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Not at the moment. Iâve been searching for so many years, but Iâm still clueless."&nbsp;</p><p>"Then... I have a solution?"&nbsp;</p><p>"How is that possible...hmm?! What?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Dad, I said I have a way!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Yo...you have a way? What kind of way?"&nbsp;</p><p>Su Qingyun looked at his daughter nodding in front of him and widened his eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>What's going on?&nbsp;</p><p>My daughter has a way?!&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Su Yuwei looked at Su Qingyun, who was stunned, and believed in the solution in Su Changqing's diary.&nbsp;</p><p>"Dad, actually... to solve this problem, all we need is a Nirvana pill. After taking other supplementary pills for a few days, I can awaken the power of the phoenix in my body!"&nbsp;</p><p>She said the solution out loud, with anticipation in her heart.&nbsp;</p><p>If she could awaken the power inside her body, would she no longer feel dizzy all the time and completely embark on the road of cultivation?&nbsp;</p><p>As for Su Changqing, she thought there was no way to question him again, because what he said was exactly the same as what her father said, without any errors.&nbsp;</p><p>"Boom!"&nbsp;</p><p>When Su Qingyun heard the answer, his mind buzzed.&nbsp;</p><p>Nirvana pill?&nbsp;</p><p>Only one pill could solve his daughter's problem?&nbsp;</p><p>Didn't he happen to have one?&nbsp;</p><p>It was originally prepared as one of many cards to be used to break through the Supreme Realm next timeâa holy grade medicine!&nbsp;</p><p>However, his daughter said that it could solve the problem of not being able to awaken the power of the phoenix inside her body!?&nbsp;</p><p>But as he thought about it...&nbsp;</p><p>Su Qingyun couldn't help but become suspicious and asked, "My dear daughter, are you... are you serious?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Dad, of course I'm serious!"&nbsp;</p><p>Su Yuwei rolled her eyes and said unceremoniously.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, she also hoped that after taking the Nirvana pill, she could awaken the power of phoenix inside her body, just like Su Changqing had said.&nbsp;</p><p>After a moment...&nbsp;</p><p>Although Su Qingyun didn't know how his daughter knew that Nirvana pill could help awaken the phoenix, he waved his hand without any hesitation.&nbsp;</p><p>"This... is the Nirvana pill."&nbsp;</p><p>In front of him, a pill that was all red with flames all around appeared.&nbsp;</p><p>He naturally wouldn't be stingy with this pill if it could solve his daughter's problem, despite it being extremely rare.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the strange Nirvana pill in front of her, Su Yuwei was stunned for a moment. She didn't expect that her father would have the medicine Su Changqing mentioned in his diary!&nbsp;</p><p>"Ah!" &nbsp;</p><p>Although she was worried in her heart, she chose to trust them.</p><p>Translation:&nbsp;</p><p>"Beloved Su Changqing, take the elixir and swallow it in one gulp!"
Witnessing this, Su Qingyun, the highest authority figure in the Da Yu Dynasty, couldn't help but feel nervous.
"How did this girl know about her own information? Especially... knowing the way to awaken the power of the phoenix inside her body..." He had more doubts, but he didn't want to disturb her.
For so many years, he had searched for many talented individuals but so far, no one had the solution!
Now...
All he needed was a Nirvana pill, along with some nourishing elixirs, and the problem could be solved?
At this moment...
"Boom!"
Su Youwei trembled all over, and the void surrounding her body shook!
Especially on her body, a stunning aura emanated!
In her pupils, a virtual image of the phoenix emerged!
And at this moment...
Su Qingyun breathed heavily and stared at his precious daughter.
"This, this, this..."
He took a cold breath and his body trembled involuntarily.
I saw...
A burst of red light flickered on his precious daughter's body, and the temperature around her was getting higher and higher!
Even the void behind her showed the illusion of a phoenix!
The biggest change was still the phoenix mark on her forehead.
Now it was flashing with a strange red light, as if it had come back to life!
With her growing strength...
Su Youwei had no time to pay attention to the outside world. She only felt that a huge fire was burning inside her body!
"So hot...huh..."
She breathed heavily, her face flushed!
However...
Under this burning feeling, she could feel that every aspect of her body was improving, as if she was sublimating!
In her mind, there was a huge phoenix figure soaring into the sky!
After almost half an hour...
Su Youwei breathed hard, her eyes brighter!
"Finally over..."
Her face was a little pale, but her aura was far stronger than before. She could feel that her body was no longer as weak as it was before.
Watching all of this...
Su Qingyun trembled excitedly, his expression full of joy!
"Good daughter... you... you..."
He looked at Su Youwei, who had even paler skin and an astonishing aura, and began to stammer: "It's a success!?"
"Who told you about this method!?"
"Quickly tell daddy, daddy will thank him very much!"
It must have been a highly skilled person who told Su Youwei this method!
Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible!
Who was it!?
Looking at Su Qingyun's urgent questioning, Su Youwei also...</p><p>Happily, her face full of smiles, she said, "Daddy, it's Su Changqing!" &nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing??? The son of the saint of the Daoist Holy Sect??" &nbsp;</p><p>Su Qingyun became more confused and panicked! &nbsp;</p><p>How is this possible? &nbsp;</p><p>Could it be that this little girl has met him before? &nbsp;</p><p>He truly deserves to be the son of the saint of the Daoist Holy Sect. This young man has done him a great favor! &nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Su Youwei's eyes shone brightly, and in her heart, she was certain that Su Changqing was the one who had been reborn and spoken of the future! &nbsp;</p><p>"Could it be that I'm really Su Changqing's Dao companion in the future?" &nbsp;</p><p>"Sob sob sob..." &nbsp;</p><p>Thinking of this, her face immediately turned red. &nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Demon Sect in the Realm of the Undisturbed Sea, on a towering and sinister-looking mountain peak shrouded in black mist, Mu Rong Dieyi was looking at the updated diary copy with a puzzled expression on her face. &nbsp;</p><p>"This Su Changqing... is the future partner of the saintess of the Daoist Holy Sect and the princess of the Great Feather Dynasty?!" &nbsp;</p><p>A look of astonishment appeared in her purple pupils, and she found it difficult to believe. &nbsp;</p><p>How could this be possible? &nbsp;</p><p>This guy really has so much ability? &nbsp;</p><p>Especially when she saw Su Changqing effortlessly answer the questions about the saintess and the princess in the diary... &nbsp;</p><p>Mu Rong Dieyi took a deep breath, and her elegant face revealed her shock! &nbsp;</p><p>"What he said... is about the problem between Ling Qianshui and Su Youwei at present?!" &nbsp;</p><p>"And he even gave a solution!?" &nbsp;</p><p>"This guy really has been reborn..." &nbsp;</p><p>The more she read, the more she felt worried and couldn't imagine how many secrets this man who had been reborn thousands of years later knew! &nbsp;</p><p>It is currently known that even in the chaos of darkness in the future, the various realms of the universe cannot escape. &nbsp;</p><p>Even Su Changqing, who resisted until the end, along with several other people, failed! &nbsp;</p><p>What happened during this time? &nbsp;</p><p>But soon... &nbsp;</p><p>"And the woman I care for the most, the one I had a past romance with..." &nbsp;</p><p>"The witch of the Mu Rong Dieyi, in the Undisturbed Sea Demon Sect, I wonder how she is now..." &nbsp;</p><p>"This girl..." &nbsp;</p><p>When she saw the contents of the diary at the back, her eyes widened! &nbsp;</p><p>What?! &nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;</p><p>The author has released a new book, and the old book with two million words has come to an end.

            <p>Chapter 1: Su Changqing Becomes Famous in Jiuxuan, the Decree of the Holy Lord!
At this moment, inside the Demon Sect, Murong Dieyi's cultivation has already reached the pinnacle of the God King realm after absorbing the Devil Fruit!&nbsp;</p><p>"Just one step away, and it will be the realm of the Saint..." she murmured as the purple light in her eyes flickered slightly, a smile appeared on her lips.&nbsp;</p><p>It was at this moment that she thought of Su Changqing once again. This guy, she would be able to see him soon. The Big Competition in the Little Fairy Platform is coming, and with many name changes on the list of Tianjiao, a battle for power is inevitable. The major forces representing the top combat power of Jiuxuan's peak, such as the God Dynasty and the Saint Domain, will participate. Yesterday, she also received a message that she would represent the Silent Sea Demon Sect tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>It was also at this moment that the Diary Copy appeared. Murong Dieyi put away her thoughts and stared curiously at the updated content.&nbsp;</p><p>"Looking back, I found that there is no one around me..." she read aloud.&nbsp;</p><p>She was originally curious about what Su Changqing would reveal, but she didn't expect that after the peak of turbulent times, the battle between the heavens would begin. Feeling shaken, she felt more sorry for him. From Su Changqing's diary, she felt a kind of indescribable vicissitudes. How much had he experienced to make his words so lonely?&nbsp;</p><p>Just imagining it in her mind, Murong Dieyi's body couldn't help but tremble slightly, her chest heaving. "The battle of the heavens? Solitude..." she murmured, taking a deep breath, "Su Changqing... wait for me, tomorrow... I'm going to find you!" &nbsp;</p><p>Through the Demon Lord's message, she learned that after discussions among the Nine Saints, Human Emperor, and others, they had already decided on their representatives from each faction. Su Changqing would represent the Dao One Saint Sect at this Jiuxuan event! She could see him tomorrow!&nbsp;</p><p>Less than half a day later, Su Changqing slightly made a move to directly suppress the top five of the original Tianjiao List, completely sweeping across the entire southern region and even causing a sensation beyond that!&nbsp;</p><p>When people heard the news, they didn't believe it! But when they truly understood the whole story, countless people were dumbfounded, their scalps exploding! One against five? Even before Su Changqing appeared, he had already suppressed all five of the top Tianjiao, making them unqualified to resist???&nbsp;</p><p>Jiuxuan exploded!&nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing took on the top five of Tianjiao alone and completely crushed them?"&nbsp;</p><p>"He... he... isn't he ranked sixth?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Is that so? Then he is more than capable enough to compete for first place!"&nbsp;</p><p>"What's going on? From what I know, whether it's Sima Chen, Wang Teng, or Jiuyou, their strength..."</p><p>ä¸å¯åç¶çæ°æ¯å¼¥æ£å¼æ¥ï¼è®©æ´ä¸ªçç¦åºé½é·å¥äºæ²¸è¾ä¹ä¸­ã

As he saw the changes, Su Changqing blinked, then seemed to remember something.
"Holy Lord's decree...Nine Profound Grand Meeting..."
He muttered, recalling the original text he had read earlier.
But that Holy Lord is really good at showing off. Is it really necessary to make such a big deal out of a decree?
At this moment, everyone's gaze in the Holy Land was directed towards the peak of the Holy Son.
In the sky,
"Changqing, the Nine Profound Grand Meeting this time will be attended by representatives of the Dao One Holy Sect."
"We are leaving today, and you... go."
The voice thundered like rolling thunder!
As soon as these words were spoken,
Su Changqing looked at the decree flashing with hazy light in front of him and reached out to take it.
"Sure enough, the plot follows the original text..."
He blinked as he looked at the decree in his hand.
This kind of celebration only occurs once every hundred years!
At the same time,
It is also organized jointly by several top Holy Lands in the Nine Profound South Territory, for various exchanges and learning opportunities.
At the same time, it is an opportunity for the Holy Land to recruit talents from all over the world.
It was precisely because of the appearance of the Heavenly Pride List that all major Holy Lands felt the pressure!
Therefore, they had to hold this grand event in advance to absorb talents and prepare for the future struggle.
After thinking it over,
A smile appeared on Su Changqing's face, muttering, "Recruiting people? Isn't that easy?" He remembered correctly that he was the Holy Son of the Dao One Holy Sect in the original text. 
Attending this event would likely bring in many talented individuals.
Even just thinking about it made him happy.

            <p>çä¿±æ¥çä¸æ ·ã &nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 1: The Hero's Fate Changes, and the Chaos Continues!&nbsp;</p><p>Lin Fan, in the future, caused irreversible damage to Jiu Xuan Tian and even caused the realm to crack, leading to the early collapse of Jiu Xuan Tian in the face of the ensuing darkness and chaos. He was one of the sources of trouble and turmoil. After obtaining the Imperial Weapon, he lost control of the spirit and was possessed, leading him to indiscriminately kill innocents in Jiu Xuan Tian, causing great losses to various factions that tried to suppress him. &nbsp;</p><p>As a result of the realm's crack, many alien races invaded through the fissure. However, the major holy sites, dynasties and sects all suffered a significant decline in power after the Battle of Destruction. They were only able to face the chaos caused by invading aliens with all-out war. &nbsp;</p><p>Looking back now, it's clear that Lin Fan was a person who deserved to be punished by everyone!&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, chaos prevailed! &nbsp;</p><p>Faced with the Battle of Destruction, I and my partners, such as the ruthless, the originless, and others, took action to suppress them successively! &nbsp;</p><p>It was then that I realized that outside Jiu Xuan Tian, there were even more powerful universes and races. However, under the invasion of the Void Clan and the Teng Snake Clan and other powerful forces, a great war was about to break out! &nbsp;</p><p>At first, Jiu Xuan Tian had a brief peace thanks to our suppression, but... even greater chaos was approaching! &nbsp;</p><p>The sky was torn apart, and worlds with far greater power than Jiu Xuan Tian intervened... The sky of Jiu Xuan Tian was shaking, and although I had single-handedly restrained countless alien races and killed them, causing the sky to rain blood for decades, even ruthless and originless were fighting bravely, but the number of alien races was simply too great, and Jiu Xuan Tian suffered heavy casualties! &nbsp;</p><p>That disaster lasted nearly a hundred years. During that time, I lost too much and gave up too much. Eventually, I forced a breakthrough at the cost of my cultivation regressing a thousand years, using my strongest attack to destroy the wasteland and seal the realm, ending the disaster! &nbsp;</p><p>But... later on, I discovered that the disaster had just begun... &nbsp;</p><p>Da Yu Dynasty, at this moment. &nbsp;</p><p>A phoenix's phantom hovered above the firmament, causing countless people of the Royal Court to tremble with fear! &nbsp;</p><p>Inside the palace, Su Youwei gave off a powerful aura. Although her eyes were still bright, she was also a bit majestic! &nbsp;</p><p>"Well...just as my future husband...sorry, Su Changqingâs plan predicted, I was able to successfully awaken the power of the phoenix inside my body!" &nbsp;</p><p>With big eyes blinking, she was delighted. &nbsp;</p><p>The feeling of weakness in her body disappeared and was replaced by an inexhaustible power! &nbsp;</p><p>With a flip of her little hand, an astonishing flame appeared, and the temperature suddenly skyrocketed, causing the surrounding space to warp! &nbsp;</p><p>Su Youwei panicked and extinguished the flame of the phoenix in her hand, feeling shaken. &nbsp;</p><p>"Wow!!!" &nbsp;</p><p>She became even more excited, as if this kind of divine power was innate in her.</p><p>As if it had all come together. But before this, Su Youwei had never practiced any martial arts! After a moment... Su Youwei had just finished her training and the diary was presented before her. "Huh? Su Changqing finally updated?" She blinked and hurriedly took a look. Lin Fan appeared? Escaped with serious injuries? As for this name, Su Youwei naturally despised it. This guy was one of the main causes of the Battle of Destruction, and now he's also one of the sources of trouble? "This person is really a big disaster!" She grunted in anger, shaking her small fist. If this bad guy Lin Fan was in front of her, she would definitely make him regret it! But after reading the diary, Su Youwei's small face showed a hint of fear, and she felt even more angry! "What!? Lin Fan did all these terrible things, almost caused the entire realm to collapse, led to the invasion of some alien races from among the many heavens, and created chaos?" She breathed heavily, even more furious! If it weren't for Su Changqing's difficult resistance, would the Nine Xuan Heaven have been completely destroyed? The thought made her tremble with anger. Such a villain really disgusted her! At this moment, "Good daughter, my good daughter, hahaha..." Su Qingyun's hearty laughter came from outside, followed by the opening of the door to the room. Seeing Dad entering the room, Su Youwei's face became cold, and she pouted and grunted, "Daddy, quickly issue a wanted order. Once someone named Lin Fan enters the territory of the Great Feather Dynasty, catch him and kill him!" "Ah???" Su Qingyun looked at his daughter's face full of coldness and those words, and was suddenly confused. What's going on? Lin Fan? A wanted order? This time he came because he saw an anomaly and knew that the little girl had awakened the Phoenix power within her body. He came over to see her and discuss how to thank the Saint Son of the Dao Yi Sect, Su Changqing. But now that he had just entered, his daughter was making this request? Su Qingyun frowned and then asked with a smile, "What's wrong, good daughter? Who is this Lin Fan, and why do you want to kill him?" "Daddy, he's just a disaster, he must be killed, you quickly issue a wanted order!" Su Youwei didn't plan to reveal too much about what she had learned from the diary. Instead, she pouted and emphasized once again. Regarding this, as the Emperor of the Great Feather Dynasty, Su Qingyun was also quite helpless. "Black Crow, pass on my instructions, issue a wanted order, set up checkpoints at all entrances of the dynasty. Anyone named Lin Fan will be arrested and punished!" Though he didn't fully understand the situation, he quickly gave the order. As he finished speaking,</p><p>A black shadow appeared outside and quickly disappeared. Upon seeing this, Su Yuwei immediately turned back to her innocent, childlike appearance and exclaimed how wonderful her father was. However, deep down, she longed to catch the guy named Lin Fan and execute him as soon as possible. According to her father's diary, if they didn't stop him, the Great Feather Dynasty would have been destroyed, and her father would have paid a great price. This could not happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Holy Dao Sect's Saintess Peak, Ling Qianxue's eyes were still cold as she expressed her frustration toward the troublesome person, muttering that the ring had something strange about it. Her anger intensified as she read the diary's copy in front of her. If it weren't for that stupid ring, she would have already killed Lin Fan, the future troublemaker. The diary revealed that he caused chaos for six months, which only ended when her senior brother sacrificed centuries of his cultivation and lifespan to prevent further disasters. It made her feel heartbroken and embarrassed to realize how much her senior brother had done to protect the world. She didn't even know what the last sentence meant, but it made her feel some type of way.&nbsp;</p><p>This is Chapter 5, and the author promises more updates with high-quality content. The author's new book has been launched, and they're eager for readers' support. Please leave a comment or a vote if you enjoyed reading it. The text at the end seems to be a request for support as well.</p>

            <p>Chapter One: Extreme Trust, Witch Can't Wait to Meet!&nbsp;</p><p>Dao Yi Holy Sect,&nbsp;</p><p>The Saint Son Peak.&nbsp;</p><p>As Su Changqing finished writing the second diary entry, he stretched lazily with a smile on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>"After seeing the content of the diary, Muroong Dieyi must be moved, right? These things are all in the original text, so I don't believe that her trust level won't increase!" he muttered softly, not worried about not getting a boost in trust level.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, he just had to wait.&nbsp;</p><p>But not long after,&nbsp;</p><p>[Ding!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Congratulations to the host for completing the second diary!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Trust levels of the three diary holders towards the second diary are as follows...]&nbsp;</p><p>[Dao Yi Holy Sect Saintess Ling Qianshu - trust level: 102!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Great Feather Dynasty Princess Su Youwei - trust level: 100!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Gloomy Sea Witch Sect Saintess Muroong Dieyi - trust level: 100!]&nbsp;</p><p>When Su Changqing saw the trust levels of the three female leads, he blinked in confusion, "What's going on??"&nbsp;</p><p>"Ling Qianshu's trust level is 102?"&nbsp;</p><p>"If it's full, shouldn't it be 100%?"&nbsp;</p><p>He looked strange and asked.&nbsp;</p><p>"The host is right, the trust level is 100%, but 102 means extreme trust. After Ling Qianshu, the trust level cap is 102!" explained the system.&nbsp;</p><p>Having received an explanation from the system, Su Changqing finally understood and nodded.&nbsp;</p><p>"So... the trust level of each diary will start at zero again."&nbsp;</p><p>After carefully thinking about it, he didn't worry too much about it. It wouldn't affect him too much anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>As long as he could make the diary holders believe in his diary, he was confident about that!&nbsp;</p><p>It was at this moment,&nbsp;</p><p>[Ding!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Congratulations to the host for gaining the trust of all three diary sub-holders towards the second diary! You will receive a reward!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Rewards are being issued...]&nbsp;</p><p>[Congratulations to the host for achieving a cultivation upgrade! Two small realms will be advanced, reaching the Triple Heaven of a Saint Person!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Congratulations to the host for gaining a holy weapon - the Immortal Blade, which can be upgraded to an imperial weapon level!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Congratulations to the host for obtaining a perfect Saint Medicine - Nine Revolutions Sky Pill, which can completely consolidate your own cultivation and hide nine strands of True Qi in the Dantian, which can be released when breaking through in the future and comprehend ultimate strength!]&nbsp;</p><p>[Congratulations to the host for obtaining a semi-imperial level treasure fragment - the Alchemy Immortal Pot Fragment X, collecting all fragments can fully unlock the Alchemy Immortal Pot!]&nbsp;</p><p>A series of sounds echoed in Su Changqing's mind.&nbsp;</p><p>As he listened to the rewards he received, his eyes brightened.&nbsp;</p><p>"The Immortal Blade? If this thing is used, wouldn't the entire Saint Son Peak be destroyed in one slash? And when in the peak of my power, even opening up the heavens would be easy."</p><p>å¿ççæ¯å¤ªçæ´äºï¼â

Proofread version: &nbsp;</p><p>"Ah..." He rubbed his hands together, his eyes filled with anticipation. Although he had heard of it, he might be the first person to actually use it. In addition, he obtained the Nine Revolving Concealment Pill, which had an astonishing effect, and a new fragment of the Refining Immortal Cauldron - a tool that only immortals could use. Just thinking about its potential made him excited. Without hesitation, Su Changqing took a deep breath and eagerly said, "I'll receive them immediately!" The moment he spoke, he felt a powerful force rush into his body and his cultivation skyrocketed at an astonishing speed! The further one progressed on the path of cultivation, the slower one's cultivation speed became, unless one had great opportunities. However, even though Su Changqing had already reached the realm of a saint, after receiving the rewards, his cultivation skyrocketed! One-dimensional Saint; Two-dimensional Saint; Two-dimensional Saint (Perfection); Triple-dimensional Saint!!! In just a moment, "Boom Boom Boom!!!" The aura of the Triple-dimensional Saint emitted by Su Changqing caused the surrounding void to resonate. He breathed out a sigh and his eyes became even brighter. It was at this moment that everyone in Daoist Holy Sect, heard the deafening sounds coming from the peak of Saint Son Mountain! "What's going on?!" "Saint Son... Saint Son Peak? What is Saint Son doing again???" "No, no, this aura..." "Ah???" After everyone realized what was happening, they all felt uneasy. Because at this moment, they could clearly feel the aura of the Saint rise to the sky! Even worse, the pressure was increasing! The terrifying aura was constantly surging, causing the sky above Saint Son Mountain to darken! Saint Son broke through again??? In the midst of the sect's shock, Su Changqing's eyes lit up and he couldn't help but summon the Immortal Slayer. "Awesome!" He looked at the black and shiny aggressive great sword in front of him and praised it. The sharp sword aura emanating from it made his skin tingle. Especially the surrounding void, it appeared to be trembling! Before Su Changqing had a chance to observe more, "Buzz!!!" Immortal Slayer hummed, and the terrifying momentum became even more violent! The whole room was filled with strong winds! Seeing this situation, Su Changqing quickly put it back into his storage space and grumbled, "You, if you're going to destroy my place!" "This thing is too violent!" With muttering in his ear, Su Changqing became more and more excited. At this point, he was finding it difficult to control his emotions. "Wait, this won't do!". He told himself to calm down. Otherwise, he might be carried away by excitement. "OK, I need to take these two things outside and study them to see if they have any other amazing effects!" Su Changqing took two big treasures and walked towards the door joyfully. As he passed by a mirror on the side, he couldn't help but take a quick glance at himself. If anyone saw him at this point, they would be shocked. Because he had already exceeded the realm of a one-dimensional saint and had reached the realm of a four-dimensional saint! However, just as he planned to control the new power, a wave of pain emanated from his body. "What's going on?" Su Changqing was puzzled, suddenly realizing that he could not control this powerful force. "What...what is happening?" He was horrified to find that this force was not obedient to him but was raging, enveloping him. "No, this force is backfiring!" Su Changqing quickly operated his own cultivation, trying to resist this backfiring force. However, more pain followed. He felt as if his body was about to be torn apart, blood spurting from his mouth. "What should I do? What should I do?" Su Changqing's consciousness became increasingly blurred, only feeling his whole body shaking in agony. At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him. It was a white-clad man, holding a Taoist book in his hand. "This is..." Su Changqing's eyes became blurry, but he could tell that the realm of this white-clad man was far beyond his own.</p><p>"Child, you can't take it lightly." He shook his head and looked at the Nine Revolution Concealing Heaven Pill in front of him. After assessing it for a moment, he swallowed it in one gulp. In an instant, Su Changqing felt his spiritual power split into nine portions, fusing into his dantian strand by strand.&nbsp;</p><p>"So, does that mean I can completely lay a solid foundation for my next breakthrough?" He blinked and smiled contentedly. But little did he know...&nbsp;</p><p>The members of the sect had already been frightened out of their wits, staring slack-jawed at the Holy Peak. "Did you all just feel that powerful force that seemed capable of ripping through the sky?"&nbsp;</p><p>"How did the Holy Son manage to break through again in just a few days, and not just one small realm but two at once?"&nbsp;</p><p>The commotion within the sect continued to escalate. Anyone who heard of Su Changqing's feat couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by a strange excitement. They couldn't even put their feelings into words...&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, in the abandoned ruins of the ancient demonic emperor at the bottom of the demonic sea...&nbsp;</p><p>Mu Rong Dieyi was meditating with her eyes closed, and her aura had grown several times stronger than before. Around her were the corpses of the beasts that had previously surrounded the demonic elemental fruit.&nbsp;</p><p>After a few moments, Mu Rong Dieyi suddenly opened her eyes, and the purple light in her eyes grew even brighter. "God King Nine Heavens..."&nbsp;</p><p>Mist swirled around her as she emanated a powerful demonic aura that caused the surrounding sea to roil violently.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as Su Changqing had said, the demonic elemental fruit had activated more of her ancient demonic bloodline! If she could fully absorb the demonic elemental fruit, she could easily reach the realm of the sage.&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking of this, a seductive smile appeared on her face. Su Changqing... At this moment, Mu Rong Dieyi was overjoyed and trembling with excitement. "Su Changqing, I can't wait to see you!!!" She licked her lips and grinned.&nbsp;</p><p>This man, how much did he know about the future? At the same time, a glimmer of fighting spirit appeared in her eyes. Since she would have a relationship with Su Changqing in the future, she had to see how powerful this man truly was!&nbsp;</p><p>Author's note: A new book has been released, and I promise to update it diligently with guaranteed quality!

            <p>Chapter One: The Witch Meets Su Changqing, the Grand Ceremony Begins!&nbsp;</p><p>Half an hour later, outside the Holy Land, hundreds of disciples of the Dao One Holy Sect stepped on the void. Su Changqing stood before everyone on the back of a unicorn beast that walked on thunder. Below, all the disciples were excited and their eyes were filled with anticipation.&nbsp;</p><p>"Our Senior Brother will surely succeed. He will definitely bring new blood to the Dao One Holy Sect!"
 
"This time, Senior Brother's reputation will surely be even greater!"
 
"Of course! Yesterday, Senior Brother single-handedly suppressed the previous top five of the Tianjiao List!"&nbsp;</p><p>The disciples eagerly discussed their expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as Su Changqing was ready to lead his people to their destination, a figure flew up to the Santai Peak. Ling Qianxue looked at Su Changqing and took a deep breath.&nbsp;</p><p>"Senior Sister, you came to see off Senior Brother!"&nbsp;</p><p>"This grand event, Senior Brother will definitely show the power of the Dao One Holy Sect!"&nbsp;</p><p>She had thought about these words for a long time but couldn't say them out loud. There were so many people present, and she didn't have the confidence to speak up. After she finished speaking, her face was flushed.&nbsp;</p><p>At the scene, all the disciples and elders were surprised to see Ling Qianxue come forward and hear her words.&nbsp;</p><p>"What is this..."&nbsp;</p><p>They looked at Su Changqing, then at Ling Qianxue. The relationship between the Holy Son and Holy Daughter was so good?&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing smiled gently at Ling Qianxue, then turned and said with a fierce look in his eyes, "Let's go!"&nbsp;</p><p>As his voice fell, the unicorn beast stomped through the void, with thunder rolling around every step it took. Other disciples each rode on their flying swords, grandly heading out.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, in a dense forest in the northern part of the South Territory, Lin Fan's injuries had mostly recovered, and he received news of the grand ceremony that was going to take place in the South Territory once every hundred years.&nbsp;</p><p>"As long as I can stand out in the grand ceremony and join another Holy Land, it will be fine!"&nbsp;</p><p>He gritted his teeth and looked into the distance. He had already heard the news of Su Changqing representing the Dao One Holy Sect in the ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>However...&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever he thought of Su Changqing, Lin Fan's eyes revealed a strong sense of envy and shock, and his heart couldn't help but quicken.&nbsp;</p><p>"One person, he swept away the previous top five in the Tianjiao List!"&nbsp;</p><p>"This guy is willing to be sixth on the list, but not go for the top spot!?"&nbsp;</p><p>He had received news yesterday that scared him. When he heard that the previous top five had challenged Su Changqing, he thought that they would definitely fall off the Tianjiao List. But he didn't expect...</p><p>Su Changqing not only suppressed the top five of the Tianjiao List with just one move, but also remained steadfast in sixth place. Lin Fan could not conceal his envy and jealousy and gritted his teeth, "Damn it, damn it!" "If it were me, with such strength, I would have challenged for a higher ranking long ago!" "However... someday, I will definitely climb to the top of the Tianjiao List!" "Anyway, when I join the Holy Land this time, I will make Su Changqing my background and make that damn Taoist Saint regret it!!" As he spoke, his eyes revealed intense confidence! His words and demeanor were filled with arrogance!&nbsp;</p><p>However, at this moment...&nbsp;</p><p>In the ring,&nbsp;</p><p>Yu Lao listened to Lin Fan's words with extreme helplessness.&nbsp;</p><p>"I beg you, can you be more low-key? Don't be reckless!"&nbsp;</p><p>He was also worried that the event would only include the top Holy Lands in the southern region. If this guy acted recklessly, he might not even be able to save him in time!&nbsp;</p><p>On the other side,&nbsp;</p><p>The Sea of Solitude, the Demon Sect.&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment,&nbsp;</p><p>An incredibly huge and completely black warship hung in mid-air, slowly starting up!&nbsp;</p><p>The ship's blackness was not due to any pigment or material, but rather was stained by countless dried blood! There were also dense and evil patterns on both sides!&nbsp;</p><p>On the ship,&nbsp;</p><p>There was a demonic flag bearing the Demon Sect's rune!&nbsp;</p><p>At this time,&nbsp;</p><p>The Demon Sect disciples stood on the ship, ready to go!&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone had an evil expression on their faces, and their eyes were cold!&nbsp;</p><p>In front of everyone,&nbsp;</p><p>Mu Rong Dieyi wore a red long skirt, her eyes looking into the distance, with a purple gaze full of anticipation.&nbsp;</p><p>"Su Changqing, I'm coming!"&nbsp;</p><p>She whispered to herself, her heart beating faster at the thought of meeting him.&nbsp;</p><p>What should she say when she saw Su Changqing?&nbsp;</p><p>Or...&nbsp;</p><p>What would Su Changqing say to her?&nbsp;</p><p>Originally, she didn't think there was anything to worry about,&nbsp;</p><p>But now...&nbsp;</p><p>Mu Rong Dieyi's hand hidden in her sleeve couldn't help but clench and loosen due to nervousness.&nbsp;</p><p>"Why do I have this feeling?"&nbsp;</p><p>Her mind was in turmoil, and she couldn't control her emotions.&nbsp;</p><p>She never expected that just one Su Changqing would make her feel so nervous.&nbsp;</p><p>At this time,&nbsp;</p><p>The close maid beside her noticed that Mu Rong Dieyi was feeling uneasy and cautiously asked, "Mo...Miss, are you okay?"&nbsp;</p><p>The Demon Sect disciples looked at Mu Rong Dieyi, but quickly averted their gazes, afraid of offending the Holy Maiden, as they might end up sinking to the depths of the Sea of Solitude if they didn't please her.</p><p>Muran Butterfly glanced at the maid next to her and shook her head. "It's nothing," she answered calmly, although she was feeling anxious on the inside.&nbsp;</p><p>She took a deep breath and began to wonder what Su Changqing looked like. After all, he was the man she had a connection with in the future. How exceptional was he?&nbsp;</p><p>She had heard that Su Changqing effortlessly defeated the previous top five of the Heavenly Elite List with just one move! &nbsp;</p><p>Several days later, on a plain in the central part of the Southern Domain, the earth trembled and roared. Endless ravines filled the surroundings, and an incredibly shocking crevice appeared in the void. &nbsp;</p><p>With a deafening noise, a magnificent palace emerged from the crack. It shone with golden light and radiated divine splendor, captivating all eyes that laid upon it. &nbsp;</p><p>The palace's doors slowly opened, and representatives from various holy lands of the Southern Domain arrived at the scene with their disciples. Surrounding the area were countless individuals with eager gazes, hoping to be picked by a holy land.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is our chance! If we can enter one of the sacred lands, it would be an enormous advantage!" many exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>"Only the holy lands pick their disciples. Unless we are like Su Changqing, who was a monster..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Right, Su Changqing, the saintly son of Daoist Sect, who single-handedly suppressed the previous top five of the Heavenly Elite List. Just how terrifying is his strength?" &nbsp;</p><p>Countless young talents from all over flocked to this place to try their luck or make a name for themselves. They were amazed by Su Changqing's legend, which continued to shock them, even after several days.&nbsp;</p><p>Apologies for any typos.

            <p>Chapter 1: The Witch is After Dao, the Male Protagonist is Worried!
After a moment,
Lin Fan emerged victorious from the chaos and stood out among the crowd.
He even passed the third assessment prepared by the Tai Xu Holy Land!
At this moment,
Tai Xu Holy Son, Ji Yifan, had a satisfied smile on his face as he looked at Lin Fan standing upright and asked, "Lin Fan, you passed the assessment, but do you want to join our Tai Xu Holy Sect?"
He saw that among all the assessments, this young man named Lin Fan was extremely outstanding!
Although this person was arrogant, he indeed had the capital to be arrogant.
Even in the middle of chaos, facing several people working together, he could easily resolve it!
Such a person carried the name of a genius!
This trip was not only for exchanging ideas with the various holy lands and collecting some intelligence, but also primarily for recruiting more talents for the holy land!
Not only Tai Xu Holy Land, but also the other holy lands.
So there were such good seedlings, he would naturally not miss them.
Upon hearing Ji Yifan's words,
Lin Fan couldn't help but show a hint of pride, an outcome he had already anticipated!
"Lin Fan, I'm willing!" 
He clasped his hands and fists together, already planning his rise after entering the holy land!
By that time...
Whether it was the Saint Son Su Changqing or their holy daughter, he would inevitably step on them!
Especially that holy daughter, he would make her pay the price!!!
In his mind, Lin Fan imagined himself reigning over the Nine Xuan Heavens, his eyes flashing with cold light!
"A gentleman takes revenge, ten years is not too late, but me... I don't need ten years!" 
He coldly smiled in his heart, imagining his wonderful future!
He himself possessed the destiny, which was told by Elder Yu.
It was also because of this that he was able to overcome many life and death crises.
With the emergence of the Tianjiao List and the great world battle?
The future Nine Xuan Heavens would tremble under his feet!!!
Ji Yifan got his answer and nodded.
"Good, then..."
"Lin Fan!!!" 
But before he finished speaking, a voice filled with killing intent and extremely coldness resounded!
In an instant, everyone present turned to look!
Ji Yifan furrowed his brows.
"Who... Ah... The Witch???" 
He had just wanted to speak up, but saw that Mu Rong Dieyi, who was leading the disciples of the Demonic Sect, was coming towards them with soaring killing intent!
Seeing the arrival of the new person, Ji Yifan's words were swallowed back.
Although the two had no intersection, they had heard a lot about the deeds of the Demonic Sect's Witch.
Although she was a female, her methods were extremely ruthless. She would not show any mercy even to her fellow sect members!
Once provoked, it would be troublesome!
Not to mention that the person she represented was the Demonic Sect, which engaged in constant slaughter.</p><p>The guy who relies on war to survive! If he doesn't handle this properly, the consequences of a war breaking out between Taixu Holy Land and the Demon Sect will be beyond his ability to handle. Lin Fan, who had been lost in his own fantasies, suddenly shuddered when he saw Muren Butterfly's cold, purple eyes filled with murderous intent.&nbsp;</p><p>A witch? Does sheâ¦ does she know him???&nbsp;</p><p>Judging from her expression, it didn't bode well! Before he could say anything, Muren Butterfly looked at him with murderous intent and raised her slender hand, saying in a cold voice, "Kill him!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes!!!"&nbsp;</p><p>Hearing this, the disciples of the Demon Sect all obeyed her command! Instantly, the demonic energy erupted from their bodies, turning into black shadows swooping down towards Lin Fan.&nbsp;</p><p>This sudden turn of events caused chaos in the entire arena.&nbsp;</p><p>"What's going on?!"&nbsp;</p><p>"What did Lin Fan do to make the Demon Sect take action against him?!"&nbsp;</p><p>"The person the Demon Sect wants to kill, I'm afraid he won't get away..."&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone looked at the murderous intent in Muren Butterfly's eyes and then at Lin Fan's confused expression. At that moment, their minds were filled with confusion. They couldn't understand what was happening.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the person in question...&nbsp;</p><p>Lin Fan watched with horror as the witch was about to take his life.&nbsp;</p><p>"You... you..."&nbsp;</p><p>"Witch, have you misunderstood something? Haven't we had any conflicts before?"&nbsp;</p><p>He was frantically shouting, and his brain was constantly trying to recall when he had any conflicts with the Demon Sect.&nbsp;</p><p>But after thinking it over, he had no recollection. So why did she want his life so badly???&nbsp;</p><p>As several formidable attacks came at him, Lin Fan had no choice but to use his secret technique to dodge them. He was in no position to fight back.&nbsp;</p><p>"Yulao, what's going on?!"&nbsp;</p><p>He anxiously asked, but he dared not be careless because all those guys were much stronger than him!&nbsp;</p><p>Even one or two might be manageable, but there were tens or even hundreds of them coming at him!&nbsp;</p><p>Despite having a powerful air transport, if he were to fight them head-on, he would be blown to smithereens.&nbsp;</p><p>Yulao, who was in the ring, heard Lin Fan's question and his face twisted, even though he was just a soul.&nbsp;</p><p>"I told you to keep a low profile. Who knows what's going on now?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Did you attack the Demon Sect while I was sleeping? I told you that the last thing you should do is antagonize the Demon Sect's people, and yet, here we are..."&nbsp;</p><p>He was really infuriated by this weak and indecisive guy. He had planned to join one of the Holy Sects, but things didn't go as planned, and the Saintess had intervened.&nbsp;</p><p>So now, after going through this entire festival, he had...</p><p>After passing the assessment, they were ready to enter the Tai Xu Holy Land, but then the witch came with her crew to take their lives! Yu Lao felt like crying but had no tears left. This kid was too much trouble! "This so-called great luck, could it be bad luck?" he thought. It was the only explanation he could think of. Lin Fan listened to Yu Lao's words and felt extremely anxious. "I...I didn't do anything!" he said, he couldn't remember having any issues with the Demon Sect. At the same time, Su Changqing looked on with great interest as Lin Fan was attacked by members of the Demon Sect. "This is just watching from the sidelines, isn't it?" he thought as he eagerly waited to watch a good show. Meanwhile, disciples of the Daoist One Holy Sect heard Lin Fan's name and immediately recognized him as the person who wanted to enter the sect not too long ago. "It's really him!" they exclaimed. "I didn't expect him to end up here, what a coincidence!" They all had a killing intent in their eyes as the Holy Maiden had ordered them to kill him if they ever saw him again. One of the disciples quickly reported to Su Changqing, "Sir, this Lin Fan is the one the Holy Maiden ordered us to kill!" "Last time, he managed to escape us, now we finally have the chance to get him..." he didn't continue his sentence, but instead waited reverently for Su Changqing's orders. "Oh?" Su Changqing pretended not to know and glanced at the reporting disciple. "Since that's the case, go and do it," he said indifferently. "Whether he lives or dies doesn't matter." When the others heard this, they nodded and left. P.S. The author of this book has released a new book and will do their best to update it frequently with high-quality content.

            <p>Chapter 4: Deceiving Everyone, Including the Brother-in-law!&nbsp;</p><p>At the scene, amidst the chaos, Xia Qingxuan was surprised to hear Su Changqing's confident words. "Among our peers, I am the only one who can surpass them all?"&nbsp;</p><p>She was shaken by this sentence. This young man from the Dao Yi Sheng Zong was so self-assured!&nbsp;</p><p>But...&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from the exclamations, no one stepped forward to refute him! From this, it was clear that these people were wary of Su Changqing!&nbsp;</p><p>But when she thought about it, Su Changqing had single-handedly swept away the previous top five on the Heavenly Pride List not long ago! With such strength, he seemed qualified to say such words!&nbsp;</p><p>But what about the top five on the list now?&nbsp;</p><p>When Xia Qingxuan thought of this, she couldn't help but think of the content of the diary she had read. "Will I become friends with this person and eventually become his dao companion..."&nbsp;</p><p>Her eyes flickered, and her doubts grew even more. Although she didn't want to believe it, Su Changqing's eyes were full of nostalgia when he looked at her. This was not the look of someone pretending. In the content of the diary, he was very meticulous in describing everything, even remembering exactly when they met and when they were together!&nbsp;</p><p>This man had been reborn! And now, he was even more mature than he was in his past life.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, right!&nbsp;</p><p>As Xia Qingxuan thought about it, she also couldn't help but be distracted by Su Changqing. "He's tired..."&nbsp;</p><p>She detected a profound exhaustion in the latest diary update. If that was the case, what had happened after she died trying to save him? How terrible was the darkness and turmoil?&nbsp;</p><p>The more she thought about it, the more her head hurt, and the more unstable her emotions became. "How could I be affected by his diary..."&nbsp;</p><p>After coming back to herself, her heart raced. Could it be that everything Su Changqing said was true, and she couldn't accept it because it was too sudden? Apart from that, the disciples of the Dao Yi Sheng Zong didn't doubt him at all. They were confident in him.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's our Saint!" "Confident, invincible, love it! It even gives me goosebumps..." "Do you even know who he is? He's our Saint!"&nbsp;</p><p>Watching Su Changqing, who was calm and composed, their expressions were filled with excitement, and their eyes were full of fanaticism!&nbsp;</p><p>This was the Saint of the Dao Yi Sheng Zong! The sixth on the Heavenly Pride List? Just an empty title! In terms of strength, he could even strive for the top position!</p><p>After all, that day, the Saint single-handedly suppressed five local geniuses who were originally in the top five. Based on this alone, he had the qualifications to say so! When Xia Yilin saw the sudden excitement on the scene, he was stunned and could not understand what was going on. "Elder San, what is he saying?" "Young Master, Su Changqing is saying that... among peers, no one can beat him." An old man next to him took a deep look at Su Changqing and then laughed lightly. Upon hearing this, Xia Yilin widened his eyes and immediately became angry, shouting at Su Changqing, "Arrogant, simply arrogant!!!!" "Don't waste time, right now, immediately, I want to challenge you!!!!" At this moment, Su Changqing looked at Xia Yilin who was gritting his teeth, smiled faintly, and continued to fabricate the diary. "Heh... Xia Yilin, he is still as simple as he was in his past life, straightforward in character." "I remember when I first met this little brother-in-law, it was during the first year of the War of the Realms. After fighting alongside Qingxuan, just because of simple conversations, he had hostility towards me and would find me to spar at any opportunity." "Oh, and this boy always likes to talk about walking the path of invincibility." "Speaking of which, Xia Yilin is really a funny guy, every time he is defeated by me, he still refuses to admit defeat. This fighting spirit of not willing to lose, sigh..." "Now, thinking back, I really miss those days." "Although the meeting time and location have changed, he... is still him." "However, the ending will still not change, how can a brother-in-law not be able to beat his little brother?" As he fabricated until this point, he inadvertently glanced at Xia Qingxuan. Either way, they were both going to deceive, isn't it a good thing for the siblings to deceive together? It was at this moment that Xia Qingxuan also saw the synchronization of the copy of the diary, and saw its content. "This..." She was stunned for a moment. Does Su Changqing really have such a deep impression of her brother? And he knows her brother's character and catchphrases? What's going on??? Could it be that the future that Su Changqing mentioned is true? But how did the copy of the diary come about? Was it because of the other party's rebirth, or because of her own persistence in the future that followed her back and was turned into a copy? When she thought about this, Xia Qingxuan felt that it was somewhat absurd, but the things that Su Changqing wrote in the diary were not wrong. "How could this be..." She took a deep breath, wanting to understand more clearly and confirm. Su Changqing noticed the fleeting curiosity in Xia Qingxuan's beautiful eyes and continued to fabricate the diary. "Actually, Yilin's character is not bad. He has his own pursuits and wants to walk his own path of invincibility."</p><p>"He was stubborn and had a fiery personality, which unfortunately led to his downfall in the future war of the heavens. After the war started a century later, A Lin was assigned to the joint forces under my command, just to hold the line against the enemy. I warned him that he should retreat immediately if he couldn't hold the line, but I underestimated his stubbornness. Even when all his comrades died, he refused to take a step back. He fought until the very end, shedding his last drop of blood, and eventually perished with the enemy. He died a hero, unafraid of death. It's strange that I failed to anticipate such an outcome. In this life, I hope this young man can mature quickly and temper his temper."&nbsp;</p><p>After synchronizing the diary copy, Xia Qingxuan trembled as she read the updated content. "What? A Lin died in the future war?" she exclaimed. "Is what Su Changqing said true? It doesn't sound fake since it will happen in the future!"&nbsp;</p><p>She breathed rapidly, trying to calm her thoughts, but the news had left her uneasy. At the same time, she also sensed Su Changqing's deep self-blame from the diary. Is this what the future will hold?&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, a voice shouted, "Su Changqing, come out and show yourself!" A childish voice rang out, and Xia Qingxuan looked towards Xia Yilin, who had walked up onto the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, countless eyes turned towards Su Changqing, some with anticipation and others with doubt. "Will he accept the challenge?" "It's exciting to see the Dao Saint's disciple in action!"&nbsp;</p><p>People whispered and discussed among themselves, while the author made an announcement for the new book release and implored the readers for support. "Please give me some support with flowers, evaluation votes, and comments. I promise to work hard and ensure the quality of the updates," the author pleaded.&nbsp;</p><p>Xia Qingxuan felt a sense of confusion and fear about the future, and the tension in the air was palpable as everyone awaited the response from Su Changqing.</p>

            <p>Chapter 4: Holy Lord, No One Can Threaten the Daoist One Sect!&nbsp;</p><p>On site, everyone was looking at the protector of Xiangyuan with their jaws dropped. "Supreme Realm!!!" "Is that the protector of Xiangyuan? Geng Mohan, the previous strongest of the Demon Race?" "My goodness, with his intervention, Su Changqing might not be able to make a move on Xiangyuan again!" They looked at the black-robed old man in astonishment.&nbsp;</p><p>Someone even recognized the old man's identity, causing a big commotion! Mu Rong Dieyi furrowed her brows tightly and stared at the old man. "Cheating!? That guy who failed to kill Su Changqing but was suppressed, now appears at this time!?" She clenched her fist and couldn't help but want to kill Xiangyuan, who was now unconscious due to his injuries. However, doing so would inevitably start a war between the Undead Demon Race and the Devil Sect!&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, Mu Rong Dieyi trembled and her heart raced. "Why do I have this impulse!?" She took a deep breath and looked at Su Changqing. Although she also wanted to kill Xiangyuan, who would be fully corrupted in the future, there's probably no way to do it with the other party's protector around.&nbsp;</p><p>However, just as everyone thought that this battle, with Su Changqing's complete dominance, was going to end...&nbsp;</p><p>Su Changqing furrowed his brows and stared at Geng Mohan with a cold expression. "Are you...threatening? Threatening the Daoist One Sect?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Sort of, but not really, in short, my Demon Race's young patriarch, you cannot kill him!" Geng Mohan's eyes were calm as he gazed at Su Changqing. At the same time, he glanced at the heavily injured and unconscious Xiangyuan next to him and felt shocked. The son of the Dao One Sect's Holy One, the sixth on the Heavenly Pride Ranking, Su Changqing, could easily dominate the entire battle. If he didn't intervene, his young patriarch might not come back alive.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Changqing smiled faintly. "Oh."&nbsp;</p><p>Seeing this, Geng Mohan looked doubtful, but suddenly...&nbsp;</p><p>"Cannot kill?"&nbsp;</p><p>A thunderous and resounding voice sounded on the scene! &nbsp;</p><p>Next, the entire Divine Palace shook, lightning flickered and thunder roared, and the clouds swirled on the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>Following that was a cataclysmic power, causing everyone on the scene to be unable to move! Even Geng Mohan, who was at the Supreme Fifth Heaven, had pupils that shrank suddenly! &nbsp;</p><p>Hearts racing, everyone present realized that they couldn't move, and their faces were full of horror!</p><p>The Void! 
Â Â Â Â Amid countless gazes, the void behind Su Changqing was torn apart, and an even more terrifying pressure descended! 
Â Â Â Â A brilliant divine light shone and a supreme phantom appeared! 
Â Â Â Â No one could see its face clearly, but everyone knew that this was a peerless powerhouse!!! 
Â Â Â Â Even surpassing the Supreme Realm! 
Â Â Â Â As the phantom appeared, the oppression on Su Changqing's body belonging to Geng Mohan vanished in the blink of an eye! 
Â Â Â Â When the phantom that wasn't the real body but made the heavens and earth tremble was seen, the disciples of Dao Yi Sacred Sect were excited and boiling with emotion! 
Â Â Â Â "Sacred Lord!!!" 
Â Â Â Â "Sacred Lord, you must help the Sacred Son vent his anger!" 
Â Â Â Â They paid their respects to the phantom with utmost respect, and then empathized with the Sacred Son's plight! 
Â Â Â Â Originally, it was a battle between the Sacred Son and Xiang Yuan, but who would have thought that the latter's protector would intervene and even make threats! 
Â Â Â Â Now that the Sacred Lord had arrived, they no longer had to worry about the Sacred Son's safety! 
Â Â Â Â Those demons would be unlucky!! 
Â Â Â Â In the various sacred places, the protectors of the various forces were all changing color! 
Â Â Â Â "Sacred Lord of Dao Yi Sacred Sect!? He... he is infamous for being overly protective of his disciples. Geng Mohan is bound to suffer!" 
Â Â Â Â "How can this be? Even though it's just a phantom of the Sacred Lord of Dao Yi Sacred Sect, it's not something that a Supreme Realm can contend against!" 
Â Â Â Â "It seems that the weight of Su Changqing's influence far exceeds our expectations." 
Â Â Â Â "Yes, I was uncertain before, but now I can be sure that Su Changqing definitely has the strength to contend for first place on the list of geniuses. Such a peerless genius will be a heavyweight in any sect..." 
Â Â Â Â Their faces showed fear towards the phantom of Dao Yi Sacred Lord, and each of them took a deep breath in shock! 
Â Â Â Â At this moment, people were even afraid to breathe! 
Â Â Â Â Amidst the surrounding gazes, Su Changqing was not surprised and his mouth slightly curled up. 
Â Â Â Â Because in the original text, he was initially regarded as a treasure by the Sacred Lord of Dao Yi Sacred Sect and received a lot of attention. 
Â Â Â Â However, in the author's writing, his behavior as a Sacred Son became more and more outrageous, causing disappointment in the Sacred Lord and the male lead to rise. 
Â Â Â Â But now, he is not the villainous Sacred Son in the original text! 
Â Â Â Â At this moment, 
Â Â Â Â The phantom of Dao Yi Sacred Lord slowly lifted its hand and pressed it towards Geng Mohan! 
Â Â Â Â "Crack..." 
Â Â Â Â The terrifying pressure was like an unstoppable force, making the void tremble, and the site of the Dao collapsed in an instant! 
Â Â Â Â It was also at this moment, 
Â Â Â Â Geng Mohan's expression changed drastically, and his body trembled! 
Â Â Â Â "Peng..." 
Â Â Â Â He suddenly spurted out blood, and the veins on his forehead showed! 
Â Â Â Â Feeling the terrifying invisible power on his body, he couldn't help but break into a cold sweat and feel a strong sense of crisis! 
Â Â Â Â Could Dao Yi Sacred Lord be trying to kill him?</p><p>"Oh darn!!! With the shadow of the Supreme Lord's image pressing down again, Geng Mohan spits out another mouthful of blood, his face turning pale. 'Supreme Lord Dao Yi, what do you mean?' he asks anxiously. The people at the scene of the ceremony are also shocked by the wave of emotion inside them. With one hand, he suppresses the Overlord! Such a supreme existence, they never had a chance to see before. But now they are witnessing such an extraordinary scene! Meanwhile, Supreme Lord Dao Yi once again suppresses Geng Mohan, causing him to tremble and bend down. 'I want to ask you, what do you mean?' He speaks calmly, but the sound is like a rolling thunder, making the entire divine palace seem about to collapse! Geng Mohan turns paler at this statement. 'Damn itâ¦' His mind trembles wildly, completely unprepared for the arrival of Supreme Lord Dao Yi! He had just wanted to scare Su Changqing and take the young clan leader awayâ¦ but he had just started to explain when Supreme Lord Dao Yi speaks again, 'Changqing, kill him, I allowed it!' 'Kill in front of everyone!' 'Even if the old monster of the demonic race comes, I want to see if he can stop you!' 'In this Nine Profound Heavens, no one can threaten the Dao Yi Sect!' His words echoed in the divine palace, dominating and overpowering. The scene was silent like death! Regardless of who they were, everyone's heart was trembling violently, shocked and terrified! 'This... is indeed the Supreme Lord Dao Yi, he... really wants Su Changqing to kill him!!!' 'Oh my god, if he really kills him, won't the Dao Yi Sect be at war with the Undead Demon Race!?' 'Could it be that the chaotic era... is really coming?!' 'Will Su Changqing kill? He... should have reservations, right?' Everyone could not control the shock in their hearts, unable to stop their exclamations and discussions!..." &nbsp;</p><p>On another note, the author has just released a new book and promises to update regularly with guaranteed quality.

            <p>Chapter 1: The Battle of the Great World, the Rise of the Proud Son, Challenging Su Changqing!&nbsp;</p><p>In the demonic sect, all disciples were pale and fearful upon seeing the current state of affairs. "The previous top five of the Proud Son List were defeated just like that? Who is this person that defeated them? His name is so unfamiliar."&nbsp;</p><p>"The first-place entry, from the Purple Clouds Taoist Palace, is surprisingly that low-key disciple from the Taoist Palace? Unbelievable..."&nbsp;</p><p>The more they looked, the more shocked they became. It seemed that the world was about to change.&nbsp;</p><p>At this moment, Mu Rong Die Yi was also staring at the Proud Son List in the sky with a trembling body. "Aren't these the five people that Su Changqing mentioned?" Her desire to meet Su Changqing became even more urgent. What else does this guy know? How much of the future does he know? Even Mu Rong Die Yi, who was always cold and overconfident, couldn't help but take a serious look when she saw the names that had replaced the previous top five on the Proud Son List.&nbsp;</p><p>"Top five...," she pondered for a moment, and a strong desire to fight welled up in her eyes. Once she completely awakens her bloodline, she will have a place on the so-called Proud Son List!&nbsp;</p><p>However, what Mu Rong Die Yi is most curious about is still Su Changqing! "I wonder how powerful this guy really is? How does he compare to the current top five on the list?" She blinked her eyes, full of curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p>...&nbsp;</p><p>Another half month passed. Although countless people longed for the Proud Son List, challenges across the land appeared every day, but it seemed that the list was unshakable. No one could replace the people on the list.&nbsp;</p><p>At this time, outside the Dao Yi Saint Sect, a deafening sound came from the sky. A visible mass of black shadows was rapidly approaching! In front of everyone, there was an astonishing giant sword, with countless black-robed figures on its blade.&nbsp;</p><p>In front of them was a young man with a dark expression and a powerful aura. Everyone who looked at him held a look of respect.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other side, you could see the winged beasts approaching the Dao Yi Saint Sect as well. Standing on them were figures that looked like humans. Especially in the front, a huge majestic dragon with horns on its head had a young man sitting cross-legged on its head, with his golden eyes fixed firmly on the Dao Yi Saint Sect.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only that, but in the north direction, the sound of war drums was pounding! A ship that covered the heavens and obscured the sun was coming from afar...</p><p>è¾¹ççè¾åå¥å­ä¹å¹½ï¼æ¶åç®åï¼å·ç¬éï¼âæ¢ç¶ä½ ä»¬é½æ¥äºï¼é£å°±å«æéå é¼äºï¼æä»¬ä¹æ³ççï¼ç¬¬å­åèé¿å¿ç©¶ç«è½å¦æ¿åå¾ä½æä»¬çææï¼â

"You? Dream on!" 
"Anyone who makes the list can be challenged. Even if you manage to beat Su Changqing, I will challenge you!" 
Jiuyou and Wang Teng, among others, all hummed coldly, their words suffused with an explosive energy. 
After a moment, 
Ling Qianxue's figure appeared in front of the group of disciples from the Dao Yi Holy Sect, looking coldly at Sima Chen and the others outside. 
"Shameless!" 
"You lost the spot and instead of figuring out how to get it back, you come here!?" 
"There's no place for you in the Dao Yi Holy Sect. Go back where you came from!" 
Her tone was icy, her chill palpable. 
Hearing this, the original top five, including Sima Chen and Wang Teng, remained unmoved and showed no intention of leaving. 
After a stalemate, 
A murderous intent flashed in Ling Qianxue's eyes as her cultivation at the level of a Divine King suddenly burst forth! 
"Since that's the case..." 
She took a deep breath, about to make a move! 
But suddenly, 
"Boom!!!" 
A booming sound resounded from the Saint Child Peak! 
Instantly, 
Sima Chen, Wang Teng, and the others' eyes flickered as they stared fixedly at the Saint Child Peak. 
"Pompous!" They all snorted, even more eagerly wanting to defeat Su Changqing and return to the prestigious rankings. 
Because a few days ago, while they were on the rankings, they could feel an inexplicable connection, making their cultivation more unobstructed! 
Vaguely, it seemed as though they had touched upon the Heavenly Dao! 
They didn't want to lose this feeling! 
Even though it was somewhat embarrassing, it was enough to bring them to the challenge stage! 
Under everyone's gaze, 
The Saint Child Peak abruptly shook violently, and the whole holy ground trembled! 
"Boom! Boom! Boom..." 
A shocking roar resounded through the heavens and the earth! 
At the same time, 
An overwhelming Qi soared into the sky, causing the world to pale, as if the end of the world had arrived! 
The pressure of the Saint's aura rose to the sky! 
Feeling the terrifying pressure that made their souls tremble, 
Ling Qianxue took a deep breath, then a glimmer of anticipation flashed across her beautiful eyes. 
"Is Senior Brother going to make a move!?" 
She breathed heavily and stopped her physical actions! 
She was going to see Senior Brother take action! 
And at this moment, 
"How boring!" 
A calm voice echoed from the Saint Child Peak. 
The expressions of Sima Chen and the others suddenly changed, then they narrowed their eyes. 
"Hmm!?" 
Before they had a chance to sneer, dark clouds blanketed the sky! 
Even the sparkling and translucent Heavenly Genius Rankings dimmed slightly! 
Then, 
An even more formidable aura descended. The surroundings--</p><p>The void trembled violently! 
Meanwhile, the holy figure of Su Changqing emerged between heaven and earth, with a cold gaze fixed upon Sima Chen and his companions outside the sacred land. 
With a single wave of his hand, the space around Sima Chen collapsed and the void exploded with a deafening sound. The terrifying aura of destruction caused the faces of the top five on the leaderboard to turn pale in fear.
